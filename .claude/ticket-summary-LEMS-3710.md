# LEMS-3710: [Radio] | (CX) | Add toggle for showing preview unshuffled

**Status:** To Do
**Type:** Software Task
**Assignee:** Tamara Bozich

## Summary

Content creators using the Radio Widget want the ability to preview choice options **unshuffled** in the editor sidebar, even when the widget is configured for randomization. This makes it easier to review content in a predictable order while authoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Edit tab preview**: Always shows choices **unshuffled** (regardless of randomize setting)
2. **Preview tab**: Shows choices **shuffled** only when the widget is configured to randomize
3. **Info tooltip**: Add a tooltip next to the "Randomize" toggle explaining that only the "Preview" tab shows shuffled choices

## Key Context

- The request came from content creators who find shuffled previews unhelpful while editing
- The Edit tab sidebar preview currently shuffles choices when randomize is on, making it harder to map choices to the editor fields
- The Preview tab is where the learner experience is simulated, so shuffling belongs there
