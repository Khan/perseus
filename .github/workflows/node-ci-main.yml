# Our jobs run like this to minimize wasting resource cycles:
#   1. Prime caches for primary configuration.  This way subsequent jobs
#      can run in parallel but rely on this primed cache.
#
# For pushes directly to a branch, we assume a PR has been used with wider
# checks, this just makes sure that our node_modules cache is update to date as
# it is used as a fallback for PRs against it.
