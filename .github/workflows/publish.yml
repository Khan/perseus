# IMPORTANT! We set concurrency to this workflow and the branch (github.ref),

# This prevents us from having two production releases publishing at the same
# time, creating a race condition, and from trying to publish multiple snapshots
# for the same PR at the same time (potentially publishing an earlier commit as
# "latest" and causing confusion).
#
# We also do not want to cancel in-progress runs, because we don't want a
# production publish to be interrupted by a snapshot publish ever.

    # This workflow will run changesets depending on two different scenarios:
    #
    # 1. If we are landing a specific commit into main (Author PR), then
    #    changesets will check if there are changes verifying the Markdown files
    #    generated automatically:
    #      a) There are new versions and there's NO Release PR, then the
    #         changesets action will create a new Release PR.
    #      b) There's a Release PR, then the changesets action will update the
    #         existing Release PR with the new commit.
    #
    #    NOTE: in both cases, changesets will modify the new version in
    #    package.json for each package, and will remove the MD files as part of the
    #    Release PR.
    #
    # 2. If we are landing the Release PR into main, then the changesets action
    #    will publish the changes to npm.
