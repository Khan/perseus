/**
 * The Rule class represents a Perseus lint rule. A Rule instance has a check()
 * method that takes the same (node, state, content) arguments that a
 * TreeTransformer traversal callback function does. Call the check() method
 * during a tree traversal to determine whether the current node of the tree
 * violates the rule. If there is no violation, then check() returns
 * null. Otherwise, it returns an object that includes the name of the rule,
 * an error message, and the start and end positions within the node's content
 * string of the lint.
 *
 * A Perseus lint rule consists of a name, a severity, a selector, a pattern
 * (RegExp) and two functions. The check() method uses the selector, pattern,
 * and functions as follows:
 *
 * - First, when determining which rules to apply to a particular piece of
 *   content, each rule can specify an optional function provided in the fifth
 *   parameter to evaluate whether or not we should be applying this rule.
 *   If the function returns false, we don't use the rule on this content.
 *
 * - Next, check() tests whether the node currently being traversed matches
 *   the selector. If it does not, then the rule does not apply at this node
 *   and there is no lint and check() returns null.
 *
 * - If the selector matched, then check() tests the text content of the node
 *   (and its children) against the pattern. If the pattern does not match,
 *   then there is no lint, and check() returns null.
 *
 * - If both the selector and pattern match, then check() calls the function
 *   passing the TraversalState object, the content string for the node, the
 *   array of nodes returned by the selector match, and the array of strings
 *   returned by the pattern match. This function can use these arguments to
 *   implement any kind of lint detection logic it wants. If it determines
 *   that there is no lint, then it should return null. Otherwise, it should
 *   return an error message as a string, or an object with `message`, `start`
 *   and `end` properties. The start and end properties are numbers that mark
 *   the beginning and end of the problematic content. Note that these numbers
 *   are relative to the content string passed to the traversal callback, not
 *   to the entire string that was used to generate the parse tree in the
 *   first place. TODO(davidflanagan): modify the simple-markdown library to
 *   have an option to add the text offset of each node to the parse
 *   tree. This will allows us to pinpoint lint errors within a long string
 *   of markdown text.
 *
 * - If the function returns null, then check() returns null. Otherwise,
 *   check() returns an object with `rule`, `message`, `start` and `end`
 *   properties. The value of the `rule` property is the name of the rule,
 *   which is useful for error reporting purposes.
 *
 * The name, severity, selector, pattern and function arguments to the Rule()
 * constructor are optional, but you may not omit both the selector and the
 * pattern. If you do not specify a selector, a default selector that matches
 * any node of type "text" will be used. If you do not specify a pattern, then
 * any node that matches the selector will be assumed to match the pattern as
 * well. If you don't pass a function as the fourth argument to the Rule()
 * constructor, then you must pass an error message string instead. If you do
 * this, you'll get a default function that unconditionally returns an object
 * that includes the error message and the start and end indexes of the
 * portion of the content string that matched the pattern. If you don't pass a
 * function in the fifth parameter, the rule will be applied in any context.
 *
 * One of the design goals of this Rule class is to allow simple lint rules to
 * be described in JSON files without any JavaScript code. So in addition to
 * the Rule() constructor, the class also defines a Rule.makeRule() factory
 * method. This method takes a single object as its argument and expects the
 * object to have four string properties. The `name` property is passed as the
 * first argument to the Rule() construtctor.  The optional `selector`
 * property, if specified, is passed to Selector.parse() and the resulting
 * Selector object is used as the second argument to Rule().  The optional
 * `pattern` property is converted to a RegExp before being passed as the
 * third argument to Rule(). (See Rule.makePattern() for details on the string
 * to RegExp conversion). Finally, the `message` property specifies an error
 * message that is passed as the final argument to Rule(). You can also use a
 * real RegExp as the value of the `pattern` property or define a custom lint
 * function on the `lint` property instead of setting the `message`
 * property. Doing either of these things means that your rule description can
 * no longer be saved in a JSON file, however.
 *
 * For example, here are two lint rules defined with Rule.makeRule():
 *
 *    let nestedLists = Rule.makeRule({
 *        name: "nested-lists",
 *        selector: "list list",
 *        message: `Nested lists:
 *    nested lists are hard to read on mobile devices;
 *    do not use additional indentation.`,
 *    });
 *
 *    let longParagraph = Rule.makeRule({
 *        name: "long-paragraph",
 *        selector: "paragraph",
 *        pattern: /^.{501,}/,
 *        lint: function(state, content, nodes, match) {
 *            return `Paragraph too long:
 *    This paragraph is ${content.length} characters long.
 *    Shorten it to 500 characters or fewer.`;
 *        },
 *    });
 *
 * Certain advanced lint rules need additional information about the content
 * being linted in order to detect lint. For example, a rule to check for
 * whitespace at the start and end of the URL for an image can't use the
 * information in the node or content arguments because the markdown parser
 * strips leading and trailing whitespace when parsing. (Nevertheless, these
 * spaces have been a practical problem for our content translation process so
 * in order to check for them, a lint rule needs access to the original
 * unparsed source text. Similarly, there are various lint rules that check
 * widget usage. For example, it is easy to write a lint rule to ensure that
 * images have alt text for images encoded in markdown. But when images are
 * added to our content via an image widget we also want to be able to check
 * for alt text. In order to do this, the lint rule needs to be able to look
 * widgets up by name in the widgets object associated with the parse tree.
 *
 * In order to support advanced linting rules like these, the check() method
 * takes a context object as its optional fourth argument, and passes this
 * object on to the lint function of each rule. Rules that require extra
 * context should not assume that they will always get it, and should verify
 * that the necessary context has been supplied before using it. Currently the
 * "content" property of the context object is the unparsed source text if
 * available, and the "widgets" property of the context object is the widget
 * object associated with that content string in the JSON object that defines
 * the Perseus article or exercise that is being linted.
