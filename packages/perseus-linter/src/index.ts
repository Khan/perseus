 * highlight argument is true, this function also modifies the parse
 * tree to add "lint" nodes that can be visually rendered,
 * highlighting the problems for the user. The optional rules argument
 * is an array of Rule objects specifying which lint rules should be
 * applied to this parse tree. When omitted, a default set of rules is used.
 *
 * The context object may have additional properties that some lint
 * rules require:
 *
 *   context.content is the source content string that was parsed to create
 *   the parse tree.
 *
 *   context.widgets is the widgets object associated
 *   with the content string
 *
 * TODO: to make this even more general, allow the first argument to be
 * a string and run the parser over it in that case? (but ignore highlight
 * in that case). This would allow the one function to be used for both
 * online linting and batch linting.
