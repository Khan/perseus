/**
 * TreeTransformer is a class for traversing and transforming trees.  Create a
 * TreeTransformer by passing the root node of the tree to the
 * constructor. Then traverse that tree by calling the traverse() method. The
 * argument to traverse() is a callback function that will be called once for
 * each node in the tree. This is a post-order depth-first traversal: the
 * callback is not called on the a way down, but on the way back up. That is,
 * the children of a node are traversed before the node itself is.
 *
 * The traversal callback function is passed three arguments, the node being
 * traversed, a TraversalState object, and the concatentated text content of
 * the node and all of its descendants. The TraversalState object is the most
 * most interesting argument: it has methods for querying the ancestors and
 * siblings of the node, and for deleting or replacing the node. These
 * transformation methods are why this class is a tree transformer and not
 * just a tree traverser.
 *
 * A typical tree traversal looks like this:
 *
 *   new TreeTransformer(root).traverse((node, state, content) => {
 *       let parent = state.parent();
 *       let previous = state.previousSibling();
 *       // etc.
 *   });
 *
 * The traverse() method descends through nodes and arrays of nodes and calls
 * the traverse callback on each node on the way back up to the root of the
 * tree. (Note that it only calls the callback on the nodes themselves, not
 * any arrays that contain nodes.) A node is loosely defined as any object
 * with a string-valued `type` property. Objects that do not have a type
 * property are assumed to not be part of the tree and are not traversed. When
 * traversing an array, all elements of the array are examined, and any that
 * are nodes or arrays are recursively traversed. When traversing a node, all
 * properties of the object are examined and any node or array values are
 * recursively traversed.  In typical parse trees, the children of a node are
 * in a `children` or `content` array, but this class is designed to handle
 * more general trees.  The Perseus markdown parser, for example, produces
 * nodes of type "table" that have children in the `header` and `cells`
 * properties.
 *
 * CAUTION: the traverse() method does not make any attempt to detect
 * cycles. If you call it on a cyclic graph instead of a tree, it will cause
 * infinite recursion (or, more likely, a stack overflow).
 *
 * TODO(davidflanagan): it probably wouldn't be hard to detect cycles: when
 * pushing a new node onto the containers stack we could just check that it
 * isn't already there.
 *
 * If a node has a text-valued `content` property, it is taken to be the
 * plain-text content of the node. The traverse() method concatenates these
 * content strings and passes them to the traversal callback for each
 * node. This means that the callback has access the full text content of its
 * node and all of the nodes descendants.
 *
 * See the TraversalState class for more information on what information and
 * methods are available to the traversal callback.
