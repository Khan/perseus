# @khanacademy/perseus

Perseus is the set of components that we use at Khan Academy to power our Exercises and Articles.

The [perseus monorepo](https://www.github.com/Khan/perseus) is home to several packages, and this is the main one! Import this to render perseus items. Currently, UI that's outside of a perseus item (check answer button, anything at the higher-than-assessment-item level) is left as an exercise for the client.
