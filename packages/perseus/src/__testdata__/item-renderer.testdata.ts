The first character in the string is at position 1.\n\nA friend points out that she can reduce the complexity of her code by using the abstractions of lists and loops. \n\nCharlotte decides to "refactor" the code, to rewrite it so that it produces the same output but is structured better.\n\n**Which of these is the best refactor of the code?**\n\n[[‚òÉ radio 1]]\n\nü§î[[‚òÉ explanation 1]]',
