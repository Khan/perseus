/*
  This file replicates the definition order of our styling when it was in LESS format.
  The styling in the original perseus-renderer.less had import statements interspersed among style definitions
    (which you can't do in regular CSS - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import).
  Therefore, the definitions are broken out into two separate CSS files (-part-1.css and -part-2.css)
    and the import order is structured to mirror the original file.
