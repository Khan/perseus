/**
 * [LEMS-3185] These are tests for the legacy Serialization API.
 *
 * This API is not built in a way that supports migrating data
 * between versions of Perseus JSON. In fact serialization
 * doesn't use WidgetOptions, but manipulated widget props; it's leveraging
 * what is considered an internal implementation detail to support
 * rehydrating previous state.
 *
 * The API is very fragile and likely broken. We have a ticket to remove it.
 * However we don't have the bandwidth to implement an alternative right now,
 * so I'm adding tests to make sure we're roughly still able to support
 * what little we've been supporting so far.
 *
 * This API needs to be removed and these tests need to be removed with it.
