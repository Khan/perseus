       Using this method of rounding the edges instead of specifying a pre-determined amount
           in order to make the measurement relative to the size of the button.
       In the case where the single-select indicator has multiple elements in its content (like a checkmark),
           the shape changes from a circle to a gel-capsule.
       This property setting automatically handles that case without the need for JS logic.
