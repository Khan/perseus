# Radio Widget Accessibility

The new Radio widget is designed to be accessible for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Keyboard Navigation

-   Users can navigate to each radio option using the `Tab` key.
-   Once focused, options can be selected with `Space` or `Enter`.
-   Only one option can be selected at a time in single-select mode
    -   Options are automatically deselected when another option is chosen.
-   Multiple options can be selected when multi-select mode is enabled.

## Screen Reader Support

-   Choices are rendered as a list, allowing screen readers to communicate the number of options to the user.
-   Choice buttons are identified as toggle buttons, in order to convey their state (selected or unselected).
    -   Buttons of type `radio` have specific expectations for interaction which do not apply to this widget.
-   Choices are labelled in the following manner: "(Choice \<letter\>) \<choice-text\>".
    -   For example, "(Choice A) Paris, France".
-   When in review mode, choices are marked as disabled,
    but learners can still navigate to them to have the screen reader review the choices and their rationales.
    -   Only correct choices are labelled as such (i.e. "Choice A, Correct").
    -   If rationale exists, it is included via `aria-describedby`,
        letting learners access that additional information in a familiar manner for expanded content.
        (content in `aria-describedby` is presented differently by different screen readers)

## Additional Notes

-   The widget leverages accessible patterns and is tested for compatibility with major screen readers and browsers.
-   If you encounter any accessibility issues, please report them to the team.
