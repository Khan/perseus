# Radio Widget Accessibility

The new Radio widget is designed to be accessible for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Keyboard Navigation

-   Users can navigate to each radio option using the `Tab` key.
-   Once focused, options can be selected with `Space` or `Enter`.
-   Arrow keys (`Up`/`Down` or `Left`/`Right`) allow users to move between radio options within the group.
-   Only one option can be selected at a time in single-select mode; multiple in multi-select mode if enabled.

## Screen Reader Support

-   The radio group and options use appropriate ARIA roles (`radiogroup`, `radio`) and attributes to communicate their state to screen readers.
-   The `aria-label` is set based on the widget's `ariaLabel` or `visibleLabel` prop, or defaults to a localized string (e.g., "Select an answer").
-   The currently selected option is announced to screen readers.

## Visible Labels and Instructions

-   If a `visibleLabel` is provided, it is rendered as a `<label>` and associated with the radio group for better accessibility.
-   Instructions or context can be provided via `ariaLabel` or visible text.

## Best Practices

-   Always provide a meaningful `visibleLabel` or `ariaLabel` for context.
-   Avoid using only color to convey meaning in radio options.
-   Ensure the radio group is not set to `readOnly` unless necessary, as this disables interaction.

## Additional Notes

-   The widget leverages accessible patterns and is tested for compatibility with major screen readers and browsers.
-   If you encounter any accessibility issues, please report them to the team.
