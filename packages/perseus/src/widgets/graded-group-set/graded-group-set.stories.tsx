// Skateboard Forces Article - demonstrates mobile article checking fix with realistic content
const skateboardForcesArticle: PerseusRenderer = {
    content: `You've decided to learn the sport of skateboarding. You go to a skate park where skaters are doing all sorts of jumps, flips, slides, and other tricks. One of the most basic jumps, the ollie, is shown below.

[[â˜ƒ image 1]]

How does a skater control the motion of a skateboard? Let's find out.

##Forces are interactions

To start moving forward, a skater can push backward on the ground with one foot as shown below.

[[â˜ƒ image 2]]

If the ground beneath the skater's foot wasn't there, moving his foot backward would *not* make him move forward.

Pushes require two objects to push against *each other*. This is called an **interaction.** The same is true for pulling: two objects interact by pulling on *each other*. An object can't change its motion by pushing or pulling on itself.

A push or pull from an interaction between two objects is called a **force.** The strength of a force is measured in units of newtons $(\\text{N}).$ For example, the skater's push against the ground may have a strength of $30\\,\\text{N}.$

Forces are modeled with arrows. The arrow points in the direction the force acts. The longer the arrow, the stronger the force. An arrow modeling a force can be labeled with a description of the force, the strength of the force, or both, like in the image below.

[[â˜ƒ image 3]]

[[â˜ƒ graded-group-set 1]]

##Newton's third law

When two objects interact, they push against each other in *opposite directions.* For example, when a skater's foot pushes *backward* against the ground, the ground pushes *forward* on the skater's foot. This makes the skater accelerate forward.

What if the skater pushes back on the ground harder? Then they speed up quicker. When they push the ground harder, the ground pushes back on them harder too. In fact, the ground pushes on the skater with *exactly the same strength* as the skater pushes on the ground.

These characteristics of interactions are always true and are summarized by Newton's third law: **When two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are always the same strength, and they always act in opposite directions.**

Said another way, when object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts a force of equal strength on object A. The forces objects A and B exert on each other act in in opposite directions.

"Object A" and "object B" can be replaced with the names of whatever objects are interacting in a given situation.  It doesn't matter which is A and which is B.
