# Interactive Graph Accessibility

The Interactive Graph widget is designed to be accessible for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Keyboard Navigation

- Users can tab to the graph and interact with graph elements using the keyboard.
- Arrow keys allow navigation and adjustment of points or shapes (if supported by the graph type).
- `Enter` or `Space` may be used to select or activate interactive elements.
- `Escape` can be used to exit or deselect elements.

## Screen Reader Support

- The widget provides ARIA labels and descriptions via the `fullGraphAriaLabel` and `fullGraphAriaDescription` props.
- Graph elements are described for screen readers, including coordinates and types of shapes.
- Equation strings and graph state can be programmatically accessed and announced.

## Visible Labels and Markings

- Axis labels and markings are visible and can be customized for clarity.
- The widget supports visible labels for axes and graph elements, improving context for all users.

## Best Practices

- Always provide meaningful `fullGraphAriaLabel` and `fullGraphAriaDescription` for context.
- Use clear axis labels and ensure sufficient color contrast for markings and shapes.
- Avoid using color as the only means of conveying information.
- Ensure interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.

## Additional Notes

- The widget supports a variety of graph types (points, lines, polygons, angles, etc.), each with accessible defaults.
- If you encounter accessibility issues, please report them to the team for improvement.
