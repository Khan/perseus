The charismatic wounded veteran Carlo Delcroix, who became the AMNIG president, is depicted presenting a model of the Casa Madre to Victory (not unlike the medieval patron Enrico Scrovegni, who offered the Arena chapel he commissioned to the Virgin Mary).\n\nThis image has some stuff in it. *Here is some italic text.* **Here is some bold text.**";
