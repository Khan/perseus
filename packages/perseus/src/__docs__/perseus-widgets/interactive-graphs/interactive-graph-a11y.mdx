# Interactive Graph Widget Accessibility

The Interactive Graph widget is designed to be fully accessible, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines. This page documents the accessibility features and considerations for the Interactive Graph widget.

## Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab**: Moves focus to the graph interface
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate and adjust points, lines, or graph elements
- **Enter/Space**: Select, place, or confirm actions
- **Escape**: Cancel current action or selection
- **Delete/Backspace**: Remove selected elements (when applicable)

## Screen Reader Support

The Interactive Graph widget uses appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure proper screen reader announcements:

- Uses semantic roles for different graph elements
- Provides accessible names and descriptions for interactive elements
- Announces coordinate positions and changes
- Communicates error states and validation feedback
- Offers context-appropriate instructions based on graph type

## Focus Management

The widget implements a logical focus order that follows visual layout. Focus indicators are clearly visible with sufficient contrast, and keyboard focus is properly managed when elements are added or removed.

## Alternative Representations

For complex graphical elements:
- Coordinates are provided as text for screen reader users
- Mathematical functions have text equivalents
- Important visual information is communicated through non-visual means

## Color Contrast

All graph elements, controls, and labels meet WCAG AA contrast requirements. Graph elements use both color and other visual indicators (like shape, pattern, or size) to convey information.

## Responsive Design

The Interactive Graph widget is designed to work across different screen sizes and zoom levels, with appropriate sizing and touch targets for mobile and tablet devices.
