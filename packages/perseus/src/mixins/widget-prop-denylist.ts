/**
 * These are things that widgets should exclude when serializing themselves.
 *
 * The use of this list needs to die. Basically, there are codepaths that
 * blindly serialize the "props" of a widget so that it can pass around its
 * info. Unfortunately, props aren't guaranteed to be serializable, and
 * automatically serializing schemaless list of attributes causes issues (e.g.
 * circular JSON structures sometimes).
 *
 * This blocks things that we know don't need to be serialized.
