# `NewTooltip`: KA tooltip component

This is a wrapper around [Wonderblock's popover component](https://github.com/Khan/wonder-blocks). It is API compatiable with Perseus and remains for compatiability and legacy reasons. If you are anyone but the Perseus group at Khan Academy please use the wonderblocks component directly.
