 * the highlightable content.
 *
 * TODO(mdr): Word index serialization is fragile in environments where the
 *     highlightable content is liable to change. Currently, our only call
 *     sites is the test prep app, which saves Perseus state against a
 *     particular *version* of a Perseus item, so it's impossible for the
 *     content to change - but, if we try to generalize further, we'll need to
 *     create new types of range serialization that are more robust to change.
 *     (Maybe some quoted text, and we scan the content for matches?)
 *
 *     Note, too, that changes to the definition of "word" are liable to break
 *     already-persisted word-index ranges, too. If we significantly change the
 *     definition, we should consider adding a versioning field here - even if
 *     we don't support *all* historical word implementations, we still might
 *     want to hide old highlights altogether if our word definition has
 *     changed sufficiently radically.
