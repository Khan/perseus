      "content": "##Scaling equations to solve systems of equations with elimination\n\n###What is it, and why is it useful?\n\nThe elimination strategy is a popular method for mathematicians who like working with integers. When the coefficients of a variable are already opposites,  we can just add the equations to get a new equation without that variable. Otherwise, we may want to multiply both sides of one equation (or both) by a constant so that we do get opposite coefficients.\n\n###Practice\n\nIf you haven't practiced [Systems of equations with elimination](/e/systems_of_equations_with_elimination_0.5?getready=pre) yet, we suggest you do that first.\n\n\n\n[[☃ graded-group-set 2]]\n\nFor more practice, go to [Systems of equations with elimination challenge](/e/systems_of_equations_with_elimination?getready=post).",
