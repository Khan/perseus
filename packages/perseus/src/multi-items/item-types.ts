/**
 * Type definitions for multi-item types, including:
 *
 * - Item: A multi-item tree wrapped in a `_multi` key, to help us recognize it
 *         as a multi-item in other contexts and avoid misinterpreting its
 *         other properties.
 * - ItemTree: A multi-item without the `_multi` key. Conforms to the Tree
 *             interface, so it's compatible with our tree traversal functions.
 * - And the various types of nodes that compose a tree.

// TODO(jeremy): I think we could refine this root type for multi items. Right
// now a _multi's value can be _anything_ including "primitive" node types such
// as "type: content" or "type: hint". That doesn't seem to match the shapes
// that are in use to date. We could also move to a strict type at that point
// because it appears that we _never_ add other root keys to an item that
// specifies the `_multi` key. I think we'd be safe to restrict this root
// object type to something like the following:
// export type Item = {|_multi: ItemArrayNode | ItemObjectNode|};
export type Item = {
    _multi: ItemTree;
