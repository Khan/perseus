# @khanacademy/pure-markdown

An extended version of `@khanacademy/simple-markdown`, `pure-markdown` is a Node-compatible wrapper around `simple-markdown`.

Contains markdown related functions in pure javascript, extracted from perseus-markdown.jsx.

Note that this file may be used in stand alone nodejs, thus do not import anything from Perseus.
