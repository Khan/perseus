 * It functions roughly like the following regex:

 *
 * Unfortunately, math may have other `$`s inside it, as
 * long as they are inside `{` braces `}`, mostly for
 * `\text{ $math$ }`.
 *
 * To parse this, we can't use a regex, since we
 * should support arbitrary nesting (even though
 * MathJax actually only supports two levels of nesting
 * here, which we *could* parse with a regex).
 *
 * Non-regex matchers like this are now a first-class
 * concept in simple-markdown. Yay!
