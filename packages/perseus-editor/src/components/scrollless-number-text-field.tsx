/**
 * This is a custom text field of type="number" for use in Perseus Editors.
 *
 * This makes it so that the text field's input number updates on scroll
 * without scrolling the page.
 *
 * NOTE 1: Native HTML number inputs do not update the number value on scroll,
 * they only scroll the page. Inputs in React do NOT work this way (explanation
 * here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68266494). By default, scrolling on a
 * focused number input in React causes BOTH the input value to change AND
 * the page to scroll. The behavior in this component is an improvement on
 * the React behavior, but it's the opposite of the native HTML behavior.
 *
 * NOTE 2: Firefox seems to have a custom override for this. Even with this
 * stopPropogation, Firefox matches the native HTML behavior.
