/* Content creators input a list of answers which are matched from top to

 * be graded as correct or incorrect (or ungraded!) first, then get more
 * general.
 *
 * We iterate through each answer, trying to match it with the user's input
 * using the following angorithm:
 * - Try to parse the user's input. If it doesn't parse then return "not
 *   graded".
 * - For each answer:
 *   ~ Try to validate the user's input against the answer. The answer is
 *     expected to parse.
 *   ~ If the user's input validates (the validator judges it "correct"), we've
 *     matched and can stop considering answers.
 * - If there were no matches or the matching answer is considered "ungraded",
 *   show the user an error. TODO(joel) - what error?
 * - Otherwise, pass through the resulting points and message.
