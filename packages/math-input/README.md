# math-input

Khan Academy's expression editor for the mobile web. Used in the [Perseus](https://github.com/khan/perseus) exercise framework to power math input and expression editing on small screens.

Built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [MathQuill](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill), [Aphrodite](https://github.com/khan/aphrodite), and more.

Try it yourself on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/alg-basics-algebraic-expressions/alg-basics-distributive-property/e/distributive-property-with-variables). (Note: you'll need to enable mobile emulation, if you're accessing the site from a desktop browser.)

## Getting started

- Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:Khan/math-input.git`
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Start the development server: `yarn start`

When you start the project you'll need to be on a device that supports touch or touch emulation to see the keyboard. The easiest way to get started is open the developer tools on Google Chrome.

## Supported Features

- Multiple keypad configurations, so as to accommodate a range of input types (i.e., fractions/mixed numbers, algebraic expressions).
- Multi-page keypads, with swipeable page navigation.
- Touch-and-drag interactions (as supported by the stock iOS and Android keypads).
- A draggable cursor with a detached handle, for fine-grained control on touch devices.
- Custom state transitions for the editing experience, to streamline expression entry.

## Demo

A live demo is available via [GitHub Pages](http://khan.github.io/math-input/). You can configure some of the keypad's behaviors, along with the set of active keys, via the [editor](http://khan.github.io/math-input/custom.html).

Note that, as the input and keypad only respond to touch events, you'll need to enable mobile emulation (e.g., as supported by Chrome) in order to use the keypad in a desktop browser.

To run the demo locally, clone the repo, `yarn install`, `yarn watch`, and open the `index.html` page. The local behaviors can similarly be customized via the editor @ `custom.html`.
