/**
 * An algorithm for computing the appropriate layout parameters for the keypad,
 * including the size of the buttons and whether or not to render fullscreen,
 * taking into account a number of factors including the size of the screen, the
 * orientation of the screen, the presence of browser chrome, the presence of
 * other exercise-related chrome, the size of the input box, the parameters that
 * define the keypad (i.e., the number of rows, columns, and pages), and so
 * forth.
 *
 * The computations herein make some strong assumptions about the sizes of
 * various other elements and the situations under which they will be visible
 * (e.g., browser chrome). However, this is just a heuristic--it's not crucial
 * that our buttons are sized in a pixel-perfect manner, but rather, that we
 * make a balanced use of space.
 *
 * Note that one goal of the algorithm is to avoid resizing the keypad in the
 * face of dynamic browser chrome. In order to avoid that awkwardness, we tend
 * to be conservative in our measurements and make things smaller than they
 * might need to be.
