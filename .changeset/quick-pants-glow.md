This change introduces the Issues Panel container (LEMS-2925), which displays a list of accessibility warnings in the editor. Each warning includes a title, description, impact, and message. The panel also uses icons to indicate whether there are issues or if all checks have passed, improving visibility and clarity for content creators.
