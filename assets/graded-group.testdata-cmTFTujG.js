Some autotrophs use light energy to synthesize their own fuel molecules, while others extract energy from chemical sources.

Bacteria that extract energy from chemical sources and use it to fix carbon are called chemosynthetic organisms.  These bacteria may be essential to communities where light is not available, like those around deep-sea vents. They can form the base of the food chain (act as primary producers) in these ecosystems.

Some bacteria have symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationships with other organisms, living inside these organisms and providing them with nutrients.
