The _Last Supper_ remained exposed to the elements, covered only with a tarp, for several months, until the refectory (the dining room of the monastery where the _Last Supper_ was painted), was rebuilt and a team of restorers began working to preserve and restore the painting.`,images:{},widgets:{"definition 1":{alignment:"default",graded:!0,options:{definition:"The Allies, led by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were the group of countries who opposed the Axis powers (Germany, Japan, and Italy) during World War II.",static:!1,togglePrompt:"Allies"},static:!1,type:"definition",version:{major:0,minor:0}}}},t={args:{item:d({question:u})}},e=()=>c.jsx(p,{json:h,useNewStyles:!0,dependencies:l});e.__docgenInfo={description:"",methods:[],displayName:"Article"};var n,i,o;t.parameters={...t.parameters,docs:{...(n=t.parameters)==null?void 0:n.docs,source:{originalSource:`{
