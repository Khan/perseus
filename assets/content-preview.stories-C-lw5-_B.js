People often associate radiation with something dangerous or scary, without really knowing what it is. In reality, we're surrounded by radiation all the time. 

**Radiation** is energy that travels through space (not just "outer space"—any space). Radiation can also interact with matter. How radiation interacts with matter depends on the type of radiation and the type of matter.

Radiation comes in many forms, one of which is *electromagnetic radiation*. Without electromagnetic radiation life on Earth would not be possible, nor would most modern technologies.

Let's take a closer look at this important and fascinating type of radiation.

##Electromagnetic radiation

As the name suggests, **electromagnetic (EM) radiation** is energy transferred by *electromagnetic fields* oscillating through space.

EM radiation is strange—it has both wave and particle properties. Let's take a look at both.

###Electromagnetic waves

An animated model of an EM wave is shown below.

The electric field $(\\vec{\\textbf{E}})$ is shown in $\\color{blue}\\textbf{blue}$, and the magnetic field $(\\vec{\\textbf{B}})$ is shown in $\\color{red}\\textbf{red}$. They're perpendicular to each other.

A changing electric field creates a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field creates an electric field. So, once the EM wave is generated it propagates itself through space!

As with any wave, EM waves have wavelength, frequency, and speed. The wave model of EM radiation works best on large scales. But what about the atomic scale?

###Photons

At the quantum level, EM radiation exists as particles. A particle of EM radiation is called a **photon**.

We can think of photons as wave *packets*—tiny bundles of EM radiation containing specific amounts of energy. Photons are visually represented using the following symbol.

All EM radiation, whether modeled as waves or photons, travels at the **speed of light** $\\textbf{(c)}$ in a vacuum: 

$\\text{c}=3\\times10^8\\space\\pu{m/s}=300{,}000{,}000\\space\\pu{m/s}$

But, EM radiation travels at a slower speed in matter, such as water or glass.`,images:{},widgets:{"image 13":{type:"image",alignment:"block",static:!1,graded:!0,options:{static:!1,title:"",range:[[0,10],[0,10]],box:[600,254],backgroundImage:{url:"https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/358a87c20ab6ee70447f5fcb547010f69986828e.jpg",width:600,height:254},labels:[],alt:"From space, the sun appears over Earth's horizon, illuminating the atmosphere as a blue layer above Earth.
