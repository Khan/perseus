# Perseus

Perseus is the technology that powers all exercises and articles at Khan Academy. Since 2013, it has been a core part of
Khan Academy's educational platform, existing both as an integrated component of the Khan Academy applications (web and mobile)
and as a separate open-source repository.

## What is Perseus?

At its core, Perseus is a specialized Markdown to React/HTML renderer with powerful educational features. It extends
standard Markdown with two key capabilities:

**1. Interactive Widgets,** Perseus can render custom React components called "widgets" that allow learners to interact with content and provide answers in various formats.

**2. Beautiful Math Rendering,** Perseus seamlessly integrates with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to display mathematical expressions and equations with high fidelity.

These capabilities make Perseus ideal for creating interactive educational content that combines explanatory text, rich media, and assessment tools.

## How Perseus Works

Perseus content is written in an extended Markdown syntax that includes:

-   Standard Markdown formatting (headings, lists, links, etc.)
-   Math expressions enclosed in dollar signs: `$y = mx + b$`
-   Widgets using the syntax: `[[â˜ƒ widget-type 1]]`, where each widget has a unique ID

When a learner interacts with widgets (such as answering questions), Perseus can:

-   Validate answers against expected solutions
-   Provide feedback and hints
-   Support a variety of input methods

## Core Components

Perseus consists of three main concepts:

### 1. Renderers

Renderers are responsible for displaying Perseus content. The three primary renderers are:

-   **ServerItemRenderer**: The main exercise renderer that handles question content, hint management, and keypad display
-   **ArticleRenderer**: Renders long-form, read-only content, with support for embedded "knowledge checks"
-   **Renderer**: The core rendering engine that manages widgets and math content display

For more detailed information on renderers, refer to the [Perseus Renderers Overview](?path=/docs/renderers-overview--docs).

### 2. Widgets

Widgets are self-contained React components that provide interactive functionality beyond standard Markdown. They can:

-   Appear within articles and exercises (in questions and hints)
-   Be nested within other widgets (e.g., the "graded-group" widget)
-   Handle various input types (multiple-choice, graphing, numeric input, etc.)
-   Validate and score user responses

### 3. Editors

Editors provide the interface for content creators to:

-   Add/Edit Perseus content
-   Configure widget settings
-   Preview content as it will appear to learners

Each widget type has its own specialized editor component.

## Data Flow

Perseus follows a straightforward data flow:

**1. Content is created and stored as structured data (PerseusItem or PerseusRenderer)**

**2. When displayed, this data is passed to the appropriate renderer**

**3. The renderer parses the content, instantiates widgets, and renders the final output**

**4. User interactions with widgets are processed and scored against expected answers**

## TypeScript Types and Conventions

Perseus uses a consistent set of types to define its data structures and components. Understanding these types is crucial for working with Perseus code effectively.

### Data Types

<Markdown>
    {`
| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| \`PerseusItem\` | Top-level structure that the \`ServerItemRenderer\` accepts. You can think of the \`PerseusItem\` type as the "data schema" for Perseus exercise questions. |
| \`PerseusArticle\` | Is just a series of \`PerseusRenderer\` objects. It can be a single object, but most often it is an array of them. These are never scored. |
| \`PerseusRenderer\` | Core structure used by Perseus. It is rendered by the \`Renderer\` component and is used through Perseus to render content (even within widgets). |
| \`WidgetExports\<T\>\` | The type defines a widget. This structure defines which React component implements the widget as well as any required data transforms and metadata. You can look up these exports by using the \`getWidgetExport(widgetType)\` function from \`widgets.ts\`. |
| \`WidgetOptions\<T\>\` | All widget options are contained within a common \"header\" object that is represented by \`WidgetOptions\<T\>\`. The \`T\` generic type in this case is the widget type name (e.g., \`dropdown\`, \`interactive-graph\`, etc.). This type contains an \`options\` key which then contains the options specific to the widget. Each widget defines its set of options through an options type (always defined in \`perseus-types.ts\`. These can be thought of as the "schema" for the widget. |
    `}
</Markdown>

### Widget Options

Each widget defines its set of options through an options type (always defined in `perseus-types.ts`. These can be thought of as the "schema" for the widget.

### React Types

Each widget is implemented as a React component. As is common with React, the component receives data via render props.
The code strives to use the following conventions to shape the various concepts of props.

<Markdown>
    {`
| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| \`WidgetProps\<T\>\` | All widgets receive a common set of props from the parent \`Renderer\` component This set of props is defined by the \`WidgetProps\<T\>\` type (\`T\` being the specific render props the widget uses). |
| \`RenderProps\` | Defines the props that are returned by the widget's \`transform\` and \`staticTransform\` functions. If these functions are not defined on the widget's \`WidgetExport\<T\>\` object, then \`RenderProps\` is synonymous with the widgets options type (ie. the type \`T\` wrapped in \`WidgetOptions\<T\>\` from \`perseus-types.ts\`). |
| External Props | In a few rare cases, this type is defined as the sum of RenderProps wrapped in \`WidgetOptions\`. |
| Scoring Data | This type defines the data that the scoring function needs in order to score the learner's guess (aka user input). |
| \`Props\` | This form the entire set of props that widget's component supports. Typically, it is defined as \`type Props = WidgetProps<RenderProps, Rubric>\`. In cases where there are \`RenderProps\` that are optional that are provided via \`DefaultProps\`, this \`Props\` type "redefines" these props as \`myProp: NonNullable<ExternalProps["myProps"]>;\`. |
    `}
</Markdown>

## Content Editing

The Perseus content editing flow follows these steps:

**1. The editor renders an `EditorPage` component**

**2. As content is edited, `onChange` callbacks are triggered**

**3. When serialization is needed, `editorPageRef.current.serialize()` is called to produce a `PerseusItem`**

This editing flow ensures that content creators can interact with widgets and preview content as it will appear to learners.
