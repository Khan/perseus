{"content":"The table below shows data from a study on the relationship between the daily amount of water given to the Lafructus plant (in milliliters), and the lifetime plant growth (in centimeters).  Suppose scientists used the line $y = 0.5x + 2$ to model growth as a function of water.\n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.
