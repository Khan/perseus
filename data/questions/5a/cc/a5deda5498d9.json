{"content":"At Fairfax swimming pool, the lifeguards have been keeping track of the daily temperature, in Fahrenheit, as well as the number of people that attend the pool each day. They have come up with the model $y =0.8x+18$ to represent the number of people as a function of the number of degrees above $60^o$.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**   \n\n**Which of the following changes would improve the fit of the model?** \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n | | | || | |\n- | - | -\n**Degrees above $60^o$** |$0$ | $10$| $20$ | $30$ | $40$|$50$\n**Residual value** | $5$ | $6$| $3$ | $5$| $4$|$7$|  \n**Number of people** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":23},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":32},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":37},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":47},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":54},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":65},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[0,23],[10,32],[20,37],[40,54],[30,47],[50,65]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,2],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,55],[20,68]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,1],"step":[5,10]},"type":"interactive-graph"},"radio 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Increase the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Increase the y-intercept of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"Decrease the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"None of the above - the model is a good fit for the data."}],"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"type":"radio"}}}
