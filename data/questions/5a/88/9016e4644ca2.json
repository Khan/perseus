{"content":"The table below shows data from a study on the relationship between the amount of time a person spends on the computer and the amount of sleep they get per night.  Suppose researchers used the line $y = -2x +11.5$ to model sleep as a function of computer time.\n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.
