{"content":"Paul runs track, and he is training to improve his time in the $400$-meter race.  He does a time trial every $10$ days to monitor his improvement.  He's used the line $y = -1.5x + 115$ to model his $400$-meter time as a function of the number of days he has trained.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**  \n\n**Would an exponential or quadratic model be a better fit for the data?**  [[☃ dropdown 1]]  \n\n | | | || ||\n- | - | -\n**Number of days** | $0$|$10$ | $20$| $30$ | $40$ | $50$\n**Residual value** | $5$ | $-10$| $-10$ | $-5$|$5$|$20$  \n**Time (seconds)** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]] \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"dropdown 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Yes","correct":true},{"content":"No","correct":false}]},"type":"dropdown"},"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":120},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":90},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":75},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":65},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":60},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":60},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[0,120],[10,90],[20,75],[30,65],[40,60],[50,60]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,5],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,55],[-10,130]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,2.5],"step":[5,20]},"type":"interactive-graph"}}}
