{"content":"In a recent study, scientists have recorded the daily amount of water given to the Lafructus plant (in milliliters), and the lifetime plant growth (in centimeters).  Suppose scientists used the line $y = 1.5x + 3$ to model growth as a function of water.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**  \n\n**Would an exponential or quadratic model be a better fit for the data?**  [[☃ dropdown 1]]  \n\n | | | || |||\n- | - | -\n**Daily water** |$0$ | $1$| $2$ | $3$ | $4$|$5$| $6$\n**Residual value** | $0.5$ | $1$| $1.5$ | $2.5$| $2.5$|$3$|$3.5$  \n**Lifetime growth** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]] |[[☃ input-number 7]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"dropdown 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Yes","correct":false},{"content":"No","correct":true}]},"type":"dropdown"},"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":3.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":5.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":7.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":10},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":11.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":13.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 7":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":15.5},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[0,3.5],[1,5.5],[2,7.5],[3,10],[4,11.5],[5,13.5],[6,15.5]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[0.5,1],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-1,7],[-5,17]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[0.25,0.5],"step":[1,2]},"type":"interactive-graph"}}}
