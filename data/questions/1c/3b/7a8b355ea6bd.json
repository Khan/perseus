{"content":"Andre is making cookies for his classmates. He has $60$ minutes before he has to leave for school. It takes $12$ minutes to bake each sheet of cookies. In the graph below, $c$ represents the number of sheets of cookies Andre bakes, and $m$ represents the number of minutes remaining until Andre has to leave for school.\n\nThe relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation:\n\n$m = 60-12c$\n\n**Plot points on the graph that show the number of minutes remaining until Andre has to leave for school if he bakes $3$ sheets of cookies and $5$ sheets of cookies.**\n\n[[â˜ƒ interactive-graph 2]]","images":{},"widgets":{"interactive-graph 2":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"url":""},"correct":{"coords":[[3,24],[5,0]],"numPoints":2,"type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":2,"type":"point"},"gridStep":[1,2],"labels":["\\text{Sheets of cookies}","\\text{Minutes remaining}"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-1,10],[-1,25]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"showTooltips":false,"snapStep":[1,1],"step":[1,2]},"static":false,"type":"interactive-graph","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}
