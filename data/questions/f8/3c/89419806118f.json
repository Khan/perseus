{"content":"Malaya has $4$ books checked out from the library. In the graph below, the variable $b$ represents the number of books Malaya decides to check out on her next library visit (she doesn't return any). The variable $t$ represents the total number of books Malaya has checked out from the library. \n\nThe relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation:\n\n$t = 4+b$\n\n**Plot points on the graph that show the total number of books Malaya will have checked out from the library if she gets $2$ books or $5$ books on her next library visit.**\n\n[[â˜ƒ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0adc33600dd34f0872764782894f8f4412e6c200.png":{"height":417,"width":652},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/186d5ac5700527aa67212626c5c5a5e85f5b2294.png":{"height":346,"width":638},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9414326460bfa10add9710ab23911ba7ed6d78b2.png":{"height":202,"width":395}},"widgets":{"interactive-graph 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"height":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":"","width":0},"correct":{"coords":[[2,6],[5,9]],"numPoints":2,"type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":2,"type":"point"},"gridStep":[1,1],"labels":["\\text{New books}","\\text{Total books}"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-1,11],[-1,11]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"showTooltips":false,"snapStep":[1,1],"step":[1,1]},"static":false,"type":"interactive-graph","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}
