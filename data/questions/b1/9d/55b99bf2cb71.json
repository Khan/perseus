{"content":"Samir is a huge fan of the University of Virginia men's basketball team.  He notices that the team tends to score more points when more fans attend the games. Samir has recorded various point totals and attendance totals, and he's come up with the model $y =0.005x+30$ to represent the number of points scored by UVA as a function of the number of fans at the game.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**   \n\n**Which of the following changes would improve the fit of the model?** \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n | | | || | |\n- | - | -\n**Fans** |$4{,}000$ | $6{,}000$| $8{,}000$ | $10{,}000$ | $12{,}000$|$14{,}000$\n**Residual value** | $-8$ | $-10$| $-8$ | $-10$| $-10$|$-12$|  \n**Points scored** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":42},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":50},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":62},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":70},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":80},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":88},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[4000,42],[6000,50],[8000,62],[10000,70],[12000,80],[14000,88]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[1000,4],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-1000,15000],[-5,100]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[500,2],"step":[2000,20]},"type":"interactive-graph"},"radio 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Increase the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Increase the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the y-intercept of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"None of the above - the model is a good fit for the data.","correct":false}],"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"type":"radio"}}}
