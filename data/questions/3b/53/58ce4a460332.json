{"content":"Marty is trying to choose a cable TV package.  He has several different options that are priced differently based on the number of channels that he buys.  He's used the line $y = 0.1x + 21$ to model the monthly price in dollars as a function of the number of channels in the TV package.\n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.  Then plot the residuals on the graph below.**   \n\n**Which of the following changes would improve the fit of the model?** \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n | | | || | |\n- | - | -\n**Channels** | $20$| $40$ | $60$ | $80$|$100$|$120$ \n**Price ($\\$$)** | $16$ | $19$| $25.5$ | $29.5$| $34$|$40.5$|  \n**Residual value** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-7},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-6},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-1.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":0.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":3},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":7.5},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[120,7.5],[80,0.5],[40,-6],[100,3],[60,-1.5],[20,-7]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,1],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,125],[-8,8]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,0.5],"step":[20,1]},"type":"interactive-graph"},"radio 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Increase the slope of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"Decrease the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Increase the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the y-intercept of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"None of the above - the model is a good fit for the data.","correct":false}],"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"type":"radio"}}}
