{"content":"For a science project Nick looked up the average annual snowfall for $6$ cities in the northern hemisphere, and he also recorded the latitude of each city.  Nick used the line $y = 3.5x - 40$ to model annual snowfall as a function of latitude.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**  \n\n**Would an exponential or quadratic model be a better fit for the data?**  [[☃ dropdown 1]]  \n\n | | | || ||\n- | - | -\n**Latitude (degrees north)** |$10$ | $20$| $30$ | $40$ | $50$|$60$\n**Residual value** | $5$ | $-15$| $-5$ | $5$|$0$|$10$  \n**Snowfall (cm)** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]] \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"dropdown 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Yes","correct":false},{"content":"No","correct":true}]},"type":"dropdown"},"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":0},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":15},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":60},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":105},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":135},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":180},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[10,0],[20,15],[30,60],[40,105],[50,135],[60,180]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,10],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,70],[-10,200]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,5],"step":[10,20]},"type":"interactive-graph"}}}
