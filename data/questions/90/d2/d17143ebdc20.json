{"content":"When it is raining outside, you tend to stay in and watch TV.  The number of hours of TV that you watch in a given week is twice the number of rainy days in that week.  In the table below, $y$ is the number of hours of TV you watch in a week, and $x$ is the number of rainy days in that week.\n\nThe relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation:\n\n$y=2x$.\n\n**Plot two points on the graph that show the number of hours of TV you watch  if there are $5$ rainy days and $7$ rainy days.**\n\n\n$x$ | $y$\n:-:|:-:\n$1$ | $2$\n$2$ | $4$\n$3$ | $6$\n$4$ | $8$\n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"interactive-graph 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"height":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":"","width":0},"correct":{"coords":[[5,10],[7,14]],"numPoints":2,"type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":2,"type":"point"},"gridStep":[1,1],"labels":["ẍẋ","ý"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-1,17],[-1,17]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[0.5,0.5],"step":[1,1]},"type":"interactive-graph","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}
