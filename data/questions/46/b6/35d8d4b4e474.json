[2] Choir singing is a popular pastime. [3] These singers often report an increased sense of well-being and camaraderie, but does this hobby actually result in better health? [4] According to multiple scientific studies, singing—especially with others—provides concrete benefits to heart and brain health. [[1]]\n \nA 2013 study at Sweden’s University of Gothenburg examined the heart rates of 18 young people as they sang and hummed [[2]] __for__ unison. Heart rate variability (HRV), the increase and decrease in heart rate, occurred simultaneously with subjects’ slowed breathing while singing. This combination of fluctuating heart rate and slowed breathing [[3]] __are__ called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and it has been proven to reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular [[4]] __disease a prior finding independent of the 2013 study.__ One interesting finding from this study is that the subjects’ heartbeats synchronized while they sang together. This may be a factor in choir singers’ reported feelings of happiness and bonding.\n \n[[5]] __People feel a keen sense of bonding when they sing together.__ Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases [[6]] __endorphins. Endorphins blunt__ pain and engender feelings of pleasure. Cortisol, a hormonal reaction to stress and the secretion of which the brain controls, decreases after choir singing. Meanwhile, oxytocin, which the brain interprets as a feeling of emotional bonding, is increased. In a study at Oxford Brookes University, researchers surveyed 375 people who either sang alone, sang in a choir, or participated in organized sports. Those who sang in choir reported the highest levels of happiness. [[7]] __Due to__ its positive side effects, therapists have used choir singing as [[8]] __an element__ for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. A study from an arts and health research center in Canterbury, England, followed the progress of patients diagnosed with depression for a year after they joined a choir. Sixty percent of patients reported improved mental health at the end of that year, and some were no longer [[9]] __experiencing suffering from clinical depression.__\n \n[[10]] From the changes in heartbeat and breathing that result in a healthier heart, to the reduction of cortisol and production of endorphins that lower stress and increase [[11]] __happiness.
