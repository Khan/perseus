{"content":"Nick has been doing pushups and then measuring the size of his bicep afterwards.  His data are shown in the table below.  Suppose he uses the line $y = x + 245$ to model his bicep size as a function of pushups.\n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.  Then plot the residuals on the graph below.**  \n\n****Would an exponential or quadratic model be a better fit for the data?****  [[☃ dropdown 1]]  \n\n | | | || ||\n- | - | -\n**Pushups** |$0$ | $10$| $20$ | $30$ | $40$|$50$\n**Size of bicep (cm)** | $245$ | $265$| $275$ | $280$| $282$|$283$\n**Residual value** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]] \n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"dropdown 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Yes","correct":true},{"content":"No","correct":false}]},"type":"dropdown"},"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":0},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":10},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":10},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-3},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-12},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[50,-12],[40,-3],[30,5],[0,0],[10,10],[20,10]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,1],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-8,60],[-15,15]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,0.5],"step":[5,2]},"type":"interactive-graph"}}}
