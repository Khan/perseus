{"content":"Throughout her college career, Alex has recorded how many hours she's spent doing schoolwork each week. She is now comparing this data with her GPA each semester, and has come up with the model $y =0.03x+2$ to represent GPA as a function of the number of hours per week she worked that semester.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**   \n\n**Which of the following changes would improve the fit of the model?** \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n | | | || | |\n- | - | -\n**Hours worked per week** |$0$ | $5$| $10$ | $15$ | $20$|$25$\n**Residual value** | $0$ | $0.05$| $0.4$ | $0.35$| $0.6$|$0.65$|  \n**GPA** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":2},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":2.2},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":2.7},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":2.8},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":3.2},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":3.4},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[0,2],[5,2.2],[10,2.7],[20,3.2],[15,2.8000000000000003],[25,3.4000000000000004]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,0.2],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,30],[-0.2,4.2]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,0.1],"step":[5,1]},"type":"interactive-graph"},"radio 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Increase the slope of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"Decrease the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Increase the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"None of the above - the model is a good fit for the data."}],"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"type":"radio"}}}
