{"content":"In his Cadillac, Lloyd is able to read the number of miles per gallon that his car is getting at any point in time.  He decides to record how many miles per gallon he gets at various speeds.  He's used the line $y = 0.2x + 14$ to model miles per gallon as a function of the speed (miles per hour).  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.  Then plot the residuals on the graph below.**   \n\n**Which of the following changes would improve the fit of the model?** \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n | | | || | |\n- | - | -\n**Speed (mph)** | $10$| $20$ | $30$ | $40$|$50$|$60$ \n**Miles per gallon** | $16.5$ | $20$| $23$ | $23.5$| $25.5$|$29.5$|  \n**Residual value** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":0.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":2},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":3},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":1.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":1.5},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":3.5},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[30,3],[50,1.5],[20,2],[60,3.5],[40,1.5],[10,0.5]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,0.5],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,70],[-5,5]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[2.5,0.25],"step":[10,1]},"type":"interactive-graph"},"radio 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Increase the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Increase the y-intercept of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"Decrease the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"None of the above - the model is a good fit for the data.","correct":false}],"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"type":"radio"}}}
