{"content":"At the gym, Abby rode a stationary bike that displayed her heart rate.  She decided to record her heart rate at different intervals, and then used the line $y = 2x + 90$ to model her heart rate as a function of the number of minutes that she had biked.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**  \n\n**Would an exponential or quadratic model be a better fit for the data?** [[☃ dropdown 1]]  \n\n | | | || ||\n- | - | -\n**Number of minutes** |$0$ | $10$| $20$ | $30$ | $40$|$50$\n**Residual value** | $5$ | $-5$| $0$ | $5$| $5$|$-5$\n**Heart Rate** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]] \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"dropdown 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Yes","correct":false},{"content":"No","correct":true}]},"type":"dropdown"},"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":95},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":105},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":130},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":155},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":175},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":185},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[0,95],[50,185],[10,105],[20,130],[30,155],[40,175]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[5,5],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-5,55],[85,190]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[5,2.5],"step":[5,20]},"type":"interactive-graph"}}}
