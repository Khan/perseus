{"content":"When it is raining outside, you tend to stay in and watch TV.  The number of hours of TV that you watch in a given week is twice the number of rainy days in that week.  In the table below, $y$ is the number of hours of TV you watch in a week, and $x$ is the number of rainy days in that week.\n\nThe relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation:\n\n$y=2x$.\n\n**Plot two points on the graph that show the number of hours of TV you watch  if there are $5$ rainy days and $7$ rainy days.**\n\n\n$x$ | $y$\n:-:|:-:\n$1$ | $2$\n$2$ | $4$\n$3$ | $6$\n$4$ | $8$\n\n[[â˜ƒ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"interactive-graph 1":{"type":"interactive-graph","alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"step":[1,1],"backgroundImage":{"url":null,"scale":1,"bottom":0,"left":0,"width":0,"height":0},"markings":"graph","labels":["x","y"],"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"range":[[-1,17],[-1,17]],"gridStep":[1,1],"snapStep":[0.5,0.5],"graph":{"type":"point","numPoints":2},"correct":{"type":"point","numPoints":2,"coords":[[5,10],[7,14]]}},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}
