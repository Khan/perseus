{"content":"Paul runs track, and he is training to improve his time in the $400$-meter race.  He does a time trial every $10$ days to monitor his improvement.  He's used the line $y = -1.5x + 120$ to model his $400$-meter time as a function of the number of days he has trained.   \n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.
