{"content":"At a research lab, scientists are curious whether the outside temperature can be predicted by the amount that crickets chirp.  So they recorded the number of cricket chirps per second, as well as the temperature as it varied throughout the day.  The data are shown in the table below.  Suppose the researchers use the line $y = 3x +45$ to model temperature as a function of cricket chirps.\n\n**In the table below, calculate the residual value for each point.  Then plot the residuals on the graph below.**  \n\n**Would an exponential or quadratic model be a better fit for the data?**  [[☃ dropdown 1]]  \n\n | | | || ||\n- | - | -\n**Cricket chirps per second** | $14$ | $15$| $16$ | $17$| $18$|$19$\n**Temperature ($^o$F)** |$85$ | $90$| $93$ | $95$ | $96$|$96.5$  \n**Residual value** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]] \n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"dropdown 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Yes","correct":true},{"content":"No","correct":false}]},"type":"dropdown"},"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-2},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":0},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":0},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-1},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-3},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":-5.5},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[19,-5.5],[17,-1],[18,-3],[15,0],[14,-2],[16,0]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[0.5,0.5],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[12,22],[-6,6]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[0.25,0.5],"step":[1,1]},"type":"interactive-graph"}}}
