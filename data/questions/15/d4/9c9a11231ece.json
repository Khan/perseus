{"content":"Lionel is at the supermarket, comparing the nutrition facts on various cereal boxes.  He notices that the more expensive cereals tend to have more calories per serving. Lionel has come up with the model $y =80x-70$ to represent the number of calories per serving as a function of price.  The table below shows the residuals generated by this model.  \n\n**In the table below, calculate the data values for each point.  Then plot the data on the graph below.**   \n\n**Which of the following changes would improve the fit of the model?** \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n | | | || | |\n- | - | -\n**Price** |$\\$2.50$ | $\\$3.00$| $\\$3.50$ | $\\$4.00$ | $\\$4.50$|$\\$5.00$\n**Residual value** | $-30$ | $-40$| $-30$ | $-30$| $-30$|$-40$|  \n**Calories per serving** | [[☃ input-number 1]] | [[☃ input-number 2]]|  [[☃ input-number 3]]| [[☃ input-number 4]]|[[☃ input-number 5]]|[[☃ input-number 6]]\n  \n\n[[☃ interactive-graph 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"input-number 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":100},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 2":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":130},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 3":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":180},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 4":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":220},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 5":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":260},"type":"input-number"},"input-number 6":{"graded":true,"options":{"answerType":"number","inexact":false,"maxError":0.1,"simplify":"required","size":"small","value":290},"type":"input-number"},"interactive-graph 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":null},"correct":{"coords":[[2.5,100],[5,290],[4.5,260],[4,220],[3.5,180],[3,130]],"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"graph":{"numPoints":"unlimited","type":"point"},"gridStep":[0.5,20],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"graph","range":[[-1,7],[-20,350]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"snapStep":[0.25,10],"step":[1,100]},"type":"interactive-graph"},"radio 1":{"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"Increase the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the slope of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Increase the y-intercept of the line.","correct":false},{"content":"Decrease the y-intercept of the line.","correct":true},{"content":"None of the above - the model is a good fit for the data."}],"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"type":"radio"}}}
