The diagram also has the unit circle and its intersection with the line that connects $z$ to the origin. The coordinates of this point are the sine and cosine of $\\theta$.\n\n- Note that because of similarity considerations, $\\dfrac{\\text{Im}(z)}{\\text{Re}(z)}=\\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}$.\n\n- Furthermore, by definition, $\\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}=\\tan\\theta$.\n\nUsing the two equalities above, we obtain the equation $\\tan\\theta=\\dfrac{\\text{Im}(z)}{\\text{Re}(z)}$. This equation is always true, no matter what $\\theta$ is or in which quadrant $z$ lies.
