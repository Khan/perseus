{"question":{"content":"The *trp* operon in *E. Coli* is a coordinately controlled set of genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. Tryptophan acts as a corepressor of the operon, which means it binds to and activates the *trp* repressor protein. This binding is more likely to occur when tryptophan is present at high levels in the cell.\n\nThe following diagram represents the genes and regulatory sequences of the *trp* operon.\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nThe following symbols represent the macromolecules involved in transcriptional regulation of the *trp* operon.\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n**Which of the following diagrams best models the regulation of the *trp* operon when tryptophan is present at high levels?**\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7f4880a6b96949cd46f0331b13dded67c282af6a.svg":{"width":260,"height":110}},"widgets":{"image 1":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[500,82],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/046527e9444436c1728ec5a754e274c84a8ae224.svg","width":500,"height":82},"labels":[],"alt":"Two parallel horizontal lines are shown with seven boxes between the lines.
