{"question":{"content":"**Stomata** (singular: stoma) are small pores found on the underside of plant leaves. Plants can open and close their stomata in response to environmental conditions. For example, when the air is hot and dry, plants will close their stomata to prevent water loss.\n\nPlants use cellular transport mechanisms (specifically, the movement of solutes) to open and close their stomata. Each stoma is surrounded by a pair of **guard cells**.  When guard cells are swollen, stomata are open. When guard cells are shrunken, stomata are closed.\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n**Complete the statements to construct an explanation for how stomata *close* in response to environmental conditions.**\n\n* For stomata to close, solutes must first [[☃ dropdown 1]] the guard cells. \n* Then, water [[☃ dropdown 2]] the guard cells by [[☃ dropdown 3]].\n* As a result, the guard cells [[☃ dropdown 4]].\n\n[[☃ explanation 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"image 1":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,293],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/b4fee170d01c732532c2fa600e177fb9de6851f0.png","width":400,"height":293},"labels":[],"alt":"A diagram shows two stomata: the one on the left is open, and the one on the right is closed.
