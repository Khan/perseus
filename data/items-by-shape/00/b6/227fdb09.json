{"question":{"content":"$\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{NFL Draftee trade value vs. Draft Number } $\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n=====\n\nThe owners of the teams in the National Football League $(\\text{NFL})$ have developed a trade value chart, which assigns a numerical value to recently drafted players. Draftees with the highest numerical value are considered to be most valuable on the trading market. For example, the number $1$ draft pick is worth $3{,}000$ draft points and could be traded for picks $2$ $($worth $2{,}600$ points$)$ and $50$ $($worth $400$ points$)$.\n\nThe scatter plot depicts the trade value, $f$,  in points, of draftees based on their draft number, $x$.  Which of the following functions best describes the relationship shown?\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]","images":{"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/8e70c59e0f0d600d1e7e78082ead65f63b8f4f4c":{"width":480,"height":480}},"widgets":{"image 1":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[435,435],"backgroundImage":{"url":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/63a0a7fab904b9f2ef1a8e5d0ea0f0fe78031497","width":435,"height":435},"labels":[],"alt":"This chart has one plot of data that starts in the upper left and trends toward the lower right at a decreasing rate of descent.\n\nThe x-axis is draft number and has 11 major tick marks from 20 to 220, in steps of 20.
