If there are fewer particles in a container, there will be less frequent collisions with the container walls, resulting in a lower pressure. Similarly, if the particles are moving slower, they will collide with the container walls less often and with less force, which also leads to a lower pressure.","hidePrompt":"Got it, thanks!","showPrompt":"Tell me more.","static":false,"widgets":{}},"static":false,"type":"explanation","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},{"content":"Let’s start by comparing the number of $\\ce{Ne}(g)$ atoms in each container.
