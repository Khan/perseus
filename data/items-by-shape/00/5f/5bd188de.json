Some players in these high-impact sports develop [[☃ definition 1]], a condition where repeated [[☃ definition 3]] result in tangles of a protein called tau building up in the brain. CTE can harm memory, thinking, and planning skills, and can even lead to death. \n\nA study examining the brains of 631 former football players revealed that 180 of them had no signs of CTE, 163 had signs of low-level CTE, and 288 had high-level CTE. Another study found that 345 out of 376 former [[☃ definition 2]] players had CTE. \n\nThankfully, most individuals who go on to develop CTE have limited or no symptoms. And while scientists may not have found a cure for the condition yet, they’re keeping their eyes on the ball, searching for the treatment that may save thousands of lives. \n\n**How does the image support readers’ understanding of the text?**\n\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n[[☃ explanation 1]]\n\n","images":{},"widgets":{"definition 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"definition":"The full name of this condition is \"chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\"","static":false,"togglePrompt":"CTE"},"static":false,"type":"definition","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"definition 2":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"definition":"the National Football League, the organization of professional football teams","static":false,"togglePrompt":"NFL"},"static":false,"type":"definition","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"definition 3":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"definition":"head injuries that result in brain damage","static":false,"togglePrompt":"traumatic head injuries"},"static":false,"type":"definition","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"explanation 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"explanation":"Image source: Image provided by the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).\n\n","hidePrompt":"Hide attribution","showPrompt":"Attribution","static":false,"widgets":{}},"static":false,"type":"explanation","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 2":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"An image of the cross sections of two brains.
