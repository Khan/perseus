This decreases the reactivity as it decreases the affinity for a nucleophilic attack. \n\n- **Steric factor**: If fewer bulky groups are attached to carbonyl carbon, easier it is for the nucleophile to approach the carbon atom. Thus, less steric hindrance increases the reactivity towards a nucleophilic attack. \n\nBased on the above two factors, let's figure out the correct answer.
