Using the observations, we can see that Liquid C evaporated the fastest, Liquid B evaporated the slowest, and Liquid A was in between. \n\nThis means that Liquid C must have the *weakest* IMFs, Liquid B must have the *strongest*, and Liquid A is somewhere *in between*.\n","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{}},{"content":"Next, let’s analyze the structures of our three given substances—hexane, water, and acetone—to determine the relative strength of their IMFs. Since the three molecules are similar in size, we can ignore the effect of size on IMFs and focus only on the molecules' polarities.\n\nStarting with hexane, we can see that it contains only nonpolar $\\ce{C-H}$ bonds, so it is nonpolar. Therefore, hexane only experiences London dispersion forces, which are the *weakest* IMFs.\n\n","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{}},{"content":"Next let's consider propanone and water. Both molecules are polar, but water contains hydrogen atoms bonded to a very electronegative oxygen atom and has lone pairs of electrons present. \n\nThis means that water experiences hydrogen bonding, which is the *strongest* IMF.

They are given the following table:\n\nName | Lewis structure \n- | :-: \npropanone |  ![C 3 H 6 O; propanone has three carbons bonded in a chain. the center carbon is double bonded to an oxygen. the outer carbons are bonded to hydrogens.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/4d949a3044950106cd773a83399deb23d9d0b577.svg)\nhexane | ![C 6 H 14; hexane has six carbons in a row, the first and last carbons are bonded to three hydrogens, while the four central carbons are bonded to 2 hydrogens.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/0138b68865786f3b0cc07cff85ec625d7790a1f2.svg)\nwater | ![H 2 O; water has a central oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogens in a bent, asymmetrical shape.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/9673c356d4a2918fef4512bf7a9e302e0e9207c1.svg)\n\nThe students decide to compare the unknown liquids' evaporation rates. Working in a fume hood, they dampen a paper towel with each liquid. They then swipe the paper towels across a surface at the same time. After 30 seconds, they observe the following:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\nLiquid A partially evaporated, Liquid B did not appear to evaporate at all, and Liquid C mostly evaporated.
