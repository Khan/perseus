Make sure to answer Parts A and B.***\n\n___\n\n**Text 1:**\n\n\nOffshore wind power involves using wind farms built at sea to create electricity. A wind farm is a group of [[☃ definition 2]] powered by moving air. Because wind is a clean resource that can be used over and over again, some see offshore wind power as key in fighting climate change. However, scientists are still studying its impact on the oceans. Planting turbines in the sea is certain to affect  creatures living there. The question is, how much? For example, it’s clear that offshore wind power increases ocean noise, which can threaten the survival of many marine species. In addition, electricity buzzing through the sea could hurt animals' abilities to communicate and detect predators. Before we can declare offshore wind power a success, its impact on the oceans needs to be studied further.\n\n___\n\n**Text 2:**\n\nA study of offshore wind farms in the Netherlands’ North Sea suggests that the large turbines have helped some forms of sea life thrive. Animals that live in soil have built new homes in the turbines at higher rates than they have in the seafloor. However, some warn that wind turbines may harm other forms of marine life. For example, some seabirds avoid wind farm areas, since the blades of the turbines can strike flying animals. In addition, constructing wind turbines creates noise that has a harmful effect on marine mammals. But it’s important to remember the purpose of wind farms is to combat climate change, a threat to life all over the world. So, while the local impact of wind farms on marine life may be mixed, clean wind energy is certain to help save the planet.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n**Part A: Both authors believe that offshore wind farms affect marine life, but the author of Text 2 argues that**\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n**Part B: Which sentence from Text 2 best advances this argument?**\n\n[[☃ radio 2]]\n\n[[☃ explanation 1]]\n\n","images":{},"widgets":{"definition 2":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"definition":"Tur·bine (tur-bine): a machine with a fast-moving wheel or rotor used for producing power","static":false,"togglePrompt":"turbines"},"static":false,"type":"definition","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"explanation 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"explanation":"Image provided by David Dixon under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en)","hidePrompt":"Hide attribution","showPrompt":"Attribution","static":false,"widgets":{}},"static":false,"type":"explanation","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"An offshore wind farm","backgroundImage":{"height":900,"url":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/f87278c3c5edef8116543bbd27a8bd9a7524c1c9.jpg","width":1200},"box":[1200,900],"caption":"\nAn offshore wind farm\n","labels":[],"range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"static":false,"title":""},"static":false,"type":"image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"radio 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"clue":"\nThis isn’t what the author of Text 2 argues.
