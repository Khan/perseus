Most of these languish in relative obscurity. But a few go viral: they {{explode}} across the web, attracting the attention of hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of people. Content that goes viral may remain in the public consciousness for days, weeks, or longer. So for those who want to reach a large audience—whether for a corporate marketing campaign, to promote a personal cause, or to show the world your cat’s amazing yodeling ability—the question of what makes content go viral online is important. Is it possible to deliberately achieve viral status? If so, what are the characteristics of viral content? \n\n　\n\n**Try questions 1-2 now.**\n\n　\n\nIn a study, researchers analyzed what content on the *New York Times’* homepage is most widely shared and found that viral content tends to be characterized by certain predictable qualities. While content may be shared for many reasons, overall, content that elicits an emotional reaction tends to be more widely shared. In addition, stories stimulating positive emotions are more widely shared than those eliciting negative feelings, and content that produces greater emotional arousal (e.g., making you feel happy or sad) is more likely to go viral. Also, anger-inducing content is more likely to be shared than sadness-inducing content because it produces greater emotional arousal or activation.\n\nThe study examined the virality of nearly 7,000 articles published online by the *New York Times*. It explored how an article’s valence (whether it was positive or negative), emotionality (strength of emotional response), and likelihood of producing specific emotions (e.g., anger, awe, anxiety, sadness) related to its likelihood of making the *Times’* most e-mailed list. Then a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to validate these underlying theories of virality. \n\nIn the study, it was hypothesized that a story’s {{valence}}, and the specific emotions it elicits, influences whether an article makes it onto the most e-mailed list. In testing this hypotheses, researchers controlled for a range of factors including where a story was featured on the website, the time it spent in {{prominent}} positions on the home page, its release timing, the author’s fame, text complexity, the author’s gender, and the article's length. Researchers also controlled for the article’s topic (e.g., sports, arts) and practical value, as well as how interesting and surprising readers rated it. They collected information about all articles appearing on the *Times’* home page over a three-month period, and focused on the 20% that made it to the website’s most e-mailed list. \n\n　\n\n**Try questions 3-4 now.**\n\n　\n\nWhat the findings mean in practice is that if you want to create content that will make a big splash, making the message positive is likely to help, and producing an emotional response is key.\n\n　\n\n**Try questions 5-9 now.**","passageTitle":"","showLineNumbers":true,"static":false},"static":false,"type":"passage","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"passage 3":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"footnotes":"","passageText":"\n\n\n　\n\n**Try questions 10-11 now.**\n\n　\n\n","passageTitle":"","showLineNumbers":true,"static":false},"static":false,"type":"passage","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}}
