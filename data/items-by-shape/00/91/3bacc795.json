For example, economist Milton Friedman claimed that {{“the gain from the education of a child accrues not only to the child or to his parents but also to other members of the society . . . by promoting a stable and democratic society.”}} According to this view, education promotes democracy by influencing the views of individuals and providing experiences that instill democratic values. Indeed, prior research has advanced three main links between education and a democratic worldview.\n\n　\n\n**Try question 1 now.**\n\n　\n\n\nThe first link draws a connection between education and tolerance. Education involves exposure to new ideas, which Seymore Lipset (1962) argued tends to make people more tolerant and open-minded. And more tolerant individuals are more likely to favor democratic principles, such as the acceptance of the rights of the opposition and of individuals that belong to marginalized groups. Bobo and Licari (1989) posited that education changes individuals’ cognitive styles in a way that makes people more likely to recognize the importance of {{extending}} civil liberties to those they dislike. Similarly, Golebiowska (1995) demonstrated that higher education fosters greater openness to political diversity. All told, various works have found education level to be an important determinant of political tolerance.\n\n　\n\n**Try question 2 now.**\n\n　\n\n\nThe second link draws a connection between education and participation. Education teaches civic skills and promotes an understanding of the political system, which increase the likelihood of political participation. Early studies of voter turnout noted that more educated individuals were more likely to cast a ballot. More recently, Glaeser (2007) found that increases in education work to favor pro-democracy groups rather than authoritarian ones. A positive association between education and political participation has been found in several studies focused on the US.\n\n　\n\n**Try question 3 now.**\n\n　\n\n\nThe third link draws a connection between widespread education and social equality. Measures of educational attainment are closely associated with income inequality: countries with higher average educational attainment experience less income inequality. Park (1996) and De Gregorio and Lee (2002) found that as the average years of education increase, income inequality decreases. And the less inequality there is, the stronger a democracy is likely to be. Boix and Stokes (2003) found that increases in economic equality increase both the chances of a democratic transition and the stability of democratic regimes.\n\n　\n\n**Try questions 4-8 now.**\n\n　\n\n","passageTitle":"","showLineNumbers":true,"static":false},"static":false,"type":"passage","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"passage 3":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"footnotes":"","passageText":"\n\n\n　\n\n**Try questions 9-11 now.**\n\n　\n\n","passageTitle":"","showLineNumbers":true,"static":false},"static":false,"type":"passage","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}}
