Accordingly, Choice D is the answer.

Two experiments were conducted to investigate the kinetics and energetics resulting from experimentally introduced mismatched base pairs.\n\n\n*Experiment 1*\n\nResearchers tested the kinetics of *Drosophila* DNA polymerase α, a four-subunit complex devoid of 3’ exonuclease activity, when it attempted to extend a new DNA strand. To introduce the mismatch, researchers used four different deoxyribose primers all labeled with 32P at their 5’ ends. Each primer contained an identical nucleotide sequence except for the last nucleotide at the 3’ end. Figure 1 shows the primer and template used to measure the enzyme's rate of extension; the rate of extension (i.e. the insertion of T opposite A in the template) was compared between matched and mismatched 3' primer termini.\n\n![](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/14ab79fca9be5339d505e0c0786bd93e657756e1.png)\n\n**Figure 1** DNA primer and template used; N = A, C, T, or G\n\nThe primers were combined into separate test tubes along with *Drosophila* DNA polymerase α, dTTP, pyrophosphatase (an enzyme that cleaves diphosphates), and the DNA template. The velocity–concentration curves for thymine insertion after each mismatch are depicted in Figure 2.\n\n![](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/dacc83e1ebe888da98e6b8cbb7defdb9ba0c4963.png)\n**Figure 2** Velocity vs. dTTP concentration for each mismatched primer–template terminus\n\n*Experiment 2*\n\nResearchers studied the melting temperatures of the last nine base pairs of the primer–template duplexes (shown in Figure 3). From these results, researchers extracted the thermodynamic data that are provided in Table 1.\n\n![](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/4a111ff32ebc5f767466c63753abb3ccdf225725.png)\n\n**Figure 3 ** Short DNA sequences studied; N = A, C, G, or T\n\n**Table 3** Thermodynamics of DNA melting\n\n![](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-content-images/beee926cd63416be62010a87e35bffef23438f96.png)\n\n*Sources: Petruska, J., Goodman, M.
