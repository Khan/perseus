This squeezing is an example of contraction, which is why the divergence there is negative.\n\nAround the middle point, the vectors all have the same $x$-component, and an equal amount of vectors have positive and negative $y$-components. There's no net squeezing or stretching, which is why the divergence there is zero.\n\nAround the right point, the vectors again have the same $x$-component, but now they point up from above and down from below.
