Similarly, a translation to the left is indicated by the first value being negative.\n\n###Sources and images\n\nFor any transformation, we have the **source** figure, which is the figure we are performing the transformation upon, and the **image** figure, which is the result of the transformation. For example, in our translation, the source point was $\\blueD{B}$ and the image point was $\\maroonD{B'}$.\n\nNote that we indicated the image by $\\maroonD{B'}$, pronounced B prime. It is common, when working with transformations, to use the same letter for the image and the source, simply adding the \"prime\" suffix to the image.","images":{"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/4cefbcb284fe4e9faa7bb67dc1c55f22534097f9":{"width":255,"height":255},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/78f0c6ffa4f435bb27d80c75adbee450ed6d7a71":{"width":281,"height":281}},"widgets":{}},{"content":"# Let's try some practice problems\n\n[[☃ explanation 1]]\n\n### Problem 1\n\n[[☃ graded-group 1]]\n\n[[☃ explanation 2]]","images":{},"widgets":{"explanation 1":{"type":"explanation","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"showPrompt":"Click here to watch Sal solving an example problem, if you want.","hidePrompt":"Hide video.","explanation":"[[☃ video 1]]","widgets":{"video 1":{"options":{"static":false,"location":"translation-example"},"type":"video","version":{"major":0,"minor":0},"id":"video 1","graded":true,"alignment":"block","static":false}}},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"graded-group 1":{"type":"graded-group","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"content":"**Translate the line segment by $\\langle -8,3 \\rangle$.**\n\n[[☃ transformer 1]]\n\n","images":{},"widgets":{"transformer 1":{"type":"transformer","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"starting":{"shape":{"type":["lineSegment"],"coords":[[7,3],[3,-4]],"options":[{}]},"transformations":[]},"graphMode":"interactive","listMode":"dynamic","tools":{"translation":{"enabled":true,"required":false,"constraints":{}},"rotation":{"enabled":false,"required":false,"constraints":{"fixed":false},"coord":[1,6]},"reflection":{"enabled":false,"required":false,"constraints":{"fixed":false},"coords":[[2,-4],[2,2]]},"dilation":{"enabled":false,"required":false,"constraints":{"fixed":false},"coord":[6,6]}},"drawSolutionShape":false,"gradeEmpty":false,"graph":{"range":[[-10,10],[-10,10]],"step":[1,1],"markings":"grid","labels":["x","y"],"backgroundImage":{"url":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/dfba975299754d2a8cc0600184bd7a9711bc175e","width":400,"height":400},"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"gridStep":[1,1],"snapStep":[0.5,0.5]},"version":1.2,"correct":{"transformations":[{"vector":[-8,3],"type":"translation"}],"shape":{"type":["lineSegment"],"coords":[[-1,6],[-5,-1]],"options":[{}]}}},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"explanation 2":{"type":"explanation","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"showPrompt":"I need help!","hidePrompt":"Got it, thanks!","explanation":"First, click on the Translate button.
