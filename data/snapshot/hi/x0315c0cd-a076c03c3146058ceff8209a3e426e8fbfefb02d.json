This also allows us to graph it.\n\nConsider, for example, the equation $\\blueD2x+\\greenD3y=\\goldD{12}$. If we set $x=0$, we get the equation $\\greenD3y=\\goldD{12}$, and we can quickly tell that $y=4$, which means the $y$-intercept is $(0,4)$.\n\nIn a similar way, we can set $y=0$ to get $\\blueD2x=\\goldD{12}$ and find that the $x$-intercept is $(6,0)$.
