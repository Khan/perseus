[{"content":"We can find the solution to a system of equations by graphing the equations. Let's do this with the following systems of equations:\n\n>$\\goldD{y=\\dfrac{1}{2}x+3}$\n\n>$\\greenE{y=x+1}$\n\n\nFirst, let's graph the first equation $\\goldD{y=\\dfrac{1}{2}x+3}$. Notice that the equation is already in $y$-intercept form so we can graph it by starting at the $y$-intercept of $3$, and then going up $1$ and to the right $2$ from there.\n\n![](web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/921005fa2f79db4f234b31a0c6c8a43cc844c90d)\n\nNext, let's graph the second equation $\\greenE{y=x+1}$ as well.\n\n![](web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/e6375c6e258926236b914265080f93bcfe988cec)\n\nThere is exactly one point where the graphs intersect.
