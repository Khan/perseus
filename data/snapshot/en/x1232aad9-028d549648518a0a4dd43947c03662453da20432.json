[{"content":"When you translate something in geometry, you're simply moving it around. You don't distort it in any way. If you translate a segment, it remains a segment, and its length doesn't change. Similarly, if you translate an angle, the measure of the angle doesn't change.\n\nThese properties may seem obvious, but they're important to keep in mind later on when we do proofs. To make sure we understand these properties, let's walk through a few examples.\n\n## Property 1: Line segments are taken to line segments of the same length.\n\n[[☃ graded-group 1]]\n\nAs you can see for yourself, the pre-image and the image are both line segments with the same length.
