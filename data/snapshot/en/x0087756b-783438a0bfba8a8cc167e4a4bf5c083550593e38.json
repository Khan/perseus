This way we can find the solution for $x$, and then substitute it into the second equation to find the solution for $y$. This is called *the substitution method.*\n\nWe are given that $\\pink y = \\pink{2x-5}$. Let's substitute this expression into the first equation and solve for $x$ as follows:\n\n$\\qquad \\begin{align} 5x-4\\pink{y}\u0026=-10\\\\\\\\\n5x-4\\cdot(\\pink{2x-5})\u0026=-10\\\\\\\\\n5x-8x+20\u0026 = -10\\\\\\\\\n-3x\u0026=-30\\\\\\\\\nx\u0026=10\n\\end{align}$\n\nSince we now know that $\\blue x=\\blue{10}$, we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for $y$ as follows:\n\n$\\qquad \\begin{align} y \u0026= 2\\cdot \\blue{x}-5 \\\\\\\\\ny\u0026=2\\cdot\\blue{10}-5\\\\\\\\\ny\u0026=15 \\end{align}$\n\nThis is the solution of the system:\n\n- $x = 10$\n\n- $y=15$","hidePrompt":"Hide explanation","showPrompt":"Explain solution","static":false},"static":false,"type":"explanation","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"graded-group 12":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"content":"**Solve the following system of equations.**\n\n$\\qquad 5x-4y = -10$\n\n$\\qquad y=2x-5$\n\n||\n:-: | :-:\n$\\qquad x=$ [[☃ numeric-input 1]] | $\\qquad y=$ [[☃ numeric-input 2]]","images":{},"widgets":{"numeric-input 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"answers":[{"maxError":null,"message":"","simplify":"required","status":"correct","strict":false,"value":10}],"coefficient":false,"labelText":"","size":"normal","static":false},"static":false,"type":"numeric-input","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"numeric-input 2":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"answers":[{"maxError":null,"message":"","simplify":"required","status":"correct","strict":false,"value":15}],"coefficient":false,"labelText":"","size":"normal","static":false},"static":false,"type":"numeric-input","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},"static":false,"type":"graded-group","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"video 12":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"location":"the-substitution-method","static":false},"static":false,"type":"video","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},{"content":"## Problem 13: Solving equations\n\n[[☃ graded-group 13]]\n\n[[☃ explanation 13]]\n\n### Related video\n\n[[☃ video 13]]","images":{},"widgets":{"explanation 13":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"explanation":"We can play around with the expressions in the answer choices to see if they are the same as $-6n+(-12)+4n$.\n\nLet's see if the first expression is equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$.\n\n$\\qquad\n\\begin{align}\n\\\\\\\\\n{4(n-3) -6n}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -6n+(-12)+4n  \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4(n-3) -6n}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n+(-12)   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4(n-3) -6n}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{(4)n-(4)3 -6n}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=}-2n-12   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4n-12 -6n}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12    \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{-2n-12}   \u0026= -2n-12 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n \\end{align}$\n\nLet's see if the second expression is equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$.\n\n$\\qquad\n\\begin{align}\n\\\\\\\\\n{2(2n-6)}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -6n+(-12)+4n  \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{2(2n-6)}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n+(-12)   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{2(2n-6)}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{(2)2n-(2)6}  \u0026\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4n-12}   \u0026\\ne -2n-12\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n \\end{align}$\n\nThe following expression is equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$ :\n\n-  ${4(n-3) -6n} $","hidePrompt":"Hide explanation","showPrompt":"Explain solution","static":false},"static":false,"type":"explanation","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"graded-group 13":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"content":"**Which expressions are equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$ ?**  \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"radio 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"$4(n-3) -6n$","correct":true},{"content":"$2(2n-6)$","correct":false},{"isNoneOfTheAbove":true}],"deselectEnabled":false,"displayCount":null,"hasNoneOfTheAbove":true,"multipleSelect":true,"onePerLine":true,"randomize":false},"static":false,"type":"radio","version":{"major":1,"minor":0}}}},"static":false,"type":"graded-group","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"video 13":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"location":"equivalent-expressions-with-distribution-and-negative-numbers","static":false},"static":false,"type":"video","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}]
