We usually ignore any resistance from the wires.  \n\n[[☃ image 7]]\n\nIn a simple circuit, the voltage supplied by the battery $ε$ is the voltage expended by the resistor $R$, and there is only one current $I$ in the circuit.\n\n###Closed circuit \n\nA closed circuit has a continuous pathway for current to flow through. In other words, there are no gaps in the circuit.\n\n[[☃ image 8]]\n\n###Open circuit\n\nAn open circuit has a gap in the circuit that does not allow current to flow through. The gap can be caused by an open switch, a broken component, or broken wire.\n\n[[☃ image 9]]\n\n###Short circuit \n\nA short is a pathway of zero resistance within a circuit (see the blue wire in Figure 9).  When there is a short circuit, all the current flows across the short because the current prefers the path of least resistance.\n\n[[☃ image 10]]\n\nFigure 10 below shows how closing a switch $S$ can divert all the current from resistor $R_2$. When switch $S$ is open (see Figure 10A), the current $I$ flows out of the positive terminal of the battery towards node $N$. Since the switch is open, no current flows through the switch and all the current flows through resistor $R_2$.  When the switch is closed (see Figure 10B), it forms a short around resistor $R_2$.  Now, once the current $I$ reaches $N$, the current bypasses $R_2$ and flows through the switch.\n\n[[☃ image 11]]","images":{},"widgets":{"image 7":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[162,214],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a7092cc0eeb8c7fca5f587faa2890423e72b5abd.png","width":162,"height":214},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":"Figure 6.
