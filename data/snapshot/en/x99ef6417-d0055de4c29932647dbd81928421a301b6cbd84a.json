[{"content":"###What is a rotation?\n\nA rotation is a type of transformation that takes each point in a figure and rotates it a certain number of degrees around a given point.\n\nFor example, this animation shows a rotation of pentagon $IDEAL$ about the point $(0,-1)$. You can see the angle of rotation at the bottom, which increases the further we rotate the figure from its original position.\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nThe result of a rotation is a new figure, called the image. The image is congruent to the original figure. \n\n*Want to learn more about different types of transformations?
