[{"content":"##What is a rotation?\n\nIn the figure below, one copy of the trapezoid is rotating around the point.\n\n![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8e275ec8b813162427cf94d29ad22e7b3775a61d.gif)\n\nIn geometry, rotations make things turn in a cycle around a definite center point. Notice that the distance of each rotated point from the center remains the same. Only the relative position changes.\n\nIn the figure below, one copy of the octagon is rotated $22\\degree$ around the point.\n\n![](web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/631fce13e34aa52a7c25d83d4be5745dcfabf8a0)\n\nNotice how the octagon's sides change direction, but the general shape remains the same. Rotations don't distort shapes, they just whirl them around. Furthermore, note that the vertex that is the center of the rotation does not move at all.\n\nNow that we've got a basic understanding of what rotations are, let's learn how to use them in a more exact manner.","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8e275ec8b813162427cf94d29ad22e7b3775a61d.gif":{"height":199,"width":199},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/631fce13e34aa52a7c25d83d4be5745dcfabf8a0":{"height":300,"width":300}},"widgets":{}},{"content":"## The angle of rotation\n\nEvery rotation is defined by two important parameters: the center of the rotation—we already went over that—and the **angle of the rotation**.
