Each floor can hold up to four departments. Arranging the floors vertically is consistent with the top-to-bottom situation. It's a good idea to only place slots where you're sure that a department will go, and we don't know yet if each floor definitely contains a department. So, the setup can be represented as:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** **Probate** is on the same floor as **Tax**—they are a pair.\n* **Rule 2:** **Health** is immediately above **Injury**.  \n* **Rule 3:** **Labor** is on a floor by itself. One way to mark that the floor is \"full\" is to draw a double line.\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* Since the floor with **Labor** has only one department, and each floor can hold a maximum of four departments, then \n* The two remaining floors must hold either three departments each, \n* Or one floor holds four departments and the other floor holds two departments.  \n* Because there are only three floors, and **Health** is *immediately* above **Injury**, only two scenarios are possible!\n\n**Scenario 1:** **Health** is on the top floor and **Injury** is on the middle floor.\n\n* In this case, **Labor** must be on the bottom floor, alone.\n\n**Scenario 2:** **Health** is on the middle floor and **Injury** is on the bottom floor.\n\n* In this case, **Labor** must be on the top floor, alone.\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nWe'll have to account for **Family** and **Securities** as we tackle the questions, since they aren't mentioned in any rules. We'll also keep the department maximum of four in mind.

There are two different kinds of employees—**FINANCE** and **graphics**—so we can list them using capital letters and lowercase letters, respectively. This is a **grouping** element. There’s another **grouping** element in that we’re putting employees into different bonus “buckets”, so that makes this a **mixed setup**. [You could also think of the bonuses as representing an ordering task if you like; it won’t change anything about our approach.]\n\nA basic diagram might look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nYou may have wanted to make your diagram with the bonuses at the top of columns instead, and that would be perfectly fine! If you drew it that way, it might look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\nIt doesn’t matter in which orientation you represent the information, so we’ll use the first diagram throughout this exercise to emphasize the aspect of “higher” bonuses above “lower” bonuses. \n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** No one in the **graphics** department receives a \\$1,000 bonus. We can note directly in the diagram that **vaughan**, **xavier**, and **zane** can’t receive a \\$1,000 bonus.\n* **Rule 2:** Any employee who was rated __Highly Effective__ receives a larger bonus than anyone in his or her department who was not rated __Highly Effective__. So **graphics** employees will be compared to other **graphics** employees, and **FINANCE** employees will be compared to other **FINANCE** employees.\n* **Rule 3:** Only **LOPEZ**, **MENG**, and **xavier** were rated __Highly Effective__. It’s a good idea to mark these three employees in your list of elements so that you can remember which ones are __Highly Effective__. We’ll circle in our diagram (and underline in these notes), but you can box, star, or do whatever you’re comfortable with:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* We know from **Rule 1** that **vaughan**, **__xavier__**, and **zane** can’t receive a \\$1,000 bonus.\n* Since **vaughan** and **zane** are *not* rated Highly Effective, we can deduce that they also can’t receive the \\$5,000 bonus (**Rules 2 and 3**).\n* That means that both **vaughan** and **zane** must receive the \\$3,000 bonus.\n* Likewise, **KIMURA** and **PETERSON** *can’t* receive a \\$5,000 bonus because they’re *not* Highly Effective. \n* Neither **__LOPEZ__** nor **__MENG__** can receive a \\$1,000 bonus either, since they *are* rated __Highly Effective__ and thus must receive a higher bonus than their departmental colleagues **KIMURA** and **PETERSON**.\n\nThis is a great start! We’ve positively established three of our seven employees, and we can move to the questions with this **initial diagram**:\n\n[[☃ image 4]]\n\nNote that we’ve removed part of the notation for Rule 2, since we already definitively placed all of the **graphics** employees.","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/35eccb73d4370da8ac98e5f8f982607a09468509.png":{"height":498,"width":756},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/56b88b7a445e601b561b3eca96675dc7085505e7.png":{"height":720,"width":694},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/931660d2edc93133fd78ae5d0e91e560e1ef31a8.png":{"height":504,"width":904},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ba969fc5a4d499361fc8e2bc77a9dcadabb85147.png":{"height":558,"width":790},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ec66dca942ee4f640f9ac75dba772a915b3a9897.png":{"height":460,"width":1042}},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A basic diagram contains a list of elements at the top and a mixed diagram below it.\n\nThe list of elements is divided into a FINANCE list and a graphics list.

We’re *also* determining whether each of the songs is a rock classic or a new composition, and that’s a **grouping** task. That means that we have a **mixed setup**, which we could represent in a basic diagram that looks like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nThis mixed diagram favors the ordering part of the setup, which can be helpful since ordering relies on spatial arrangement whereas grouping does not. If we encounter a rule that’s purely a grouping rule, we’ll likely need to note it off to the side and hope we can incorporate it into the diagram via deductions at some point.\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** **S** occupies the fourth track of the CD. This is an ordering rule, and we can notate it directly into the diagram. \n\n* **Rule 2:** Both **W** and **Y** precede **S** on the CD. This is an ordering rule, and we can show the relationships using dashes. It’s worth adding that we *don’t* know the relationship between **W** and **Y**—only that they’re both earlier than **S**.\n\n* **Rule 3:** **T** precedes **W** on the CD. This is another ordering rule that we can note below the diagram, using a dash.\n\n* **Rule 4:** A ***rock*** classic occupies the sixth track of the CD. This is an ordering rule that we can note directly into the diagram.\n\n* **Rule 5:** Each ***rock*** classic is immediately preceded on the CD by a ***new*** composition. This is an ordering rule that is actually a conditional logic rule. ***Be careful***—what this rule *doesn’t* mean is that a ***new*** composition is followed by a ***rock*** composition. What it *does* mean is that *if* a ***rock*** piece takes up a certain spot, then a ***new*** composition must be in the spot immediately before it.\n\n* **Rule 6:** **Z** is a ***rock*** classic. This is our one grouping rule, so we can note it to the side in a rectangle:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* We can combine Rules 1, 2, and 3: **T** is earlier than **W**, and both **W** and **Y** are earlier than **S**. \n* Helpfully, **S** is in the 4th spot (Rule 1) so that means that the first three spots *must* be **T**, **W**, and **Y** in some order.\n* Since **W** can’t be 1st (since **T** is earlier than it), either **T** or **Y** must be 1st.\n* Any of the three can be 2nd.\n* Since **T** can’t be 3rd (since **T** is earlier than **W** and **W** is earlier than **S**), only **W** or **Y** can be 3rd.\n* That leaves **V**, **X**, and **Z** to be *after* **S** in the 5th, 6th, and 7th spots—in some order.\n* We’ll come back to these songs after looking at the ***rock*** and ***new*** rules. \n* Since each ***rock*** piece must be immediately preceded by a ***new*** piece (Rule 5), the 5th song must be a ***new*** piece.\n* We can also deduce that the 7th song *can’t* be a ***rock*** piece (since that would mean that the 6th song is a ***new*** piece, which Rule 4 says can’t happen), so the 7th song must be a ***new*** piece. \n* The 1st song also *can’t* be a ***rock*** piece, since all ***rock*** pieces must have a ***new*** piece right before it. So, \n* The 1st song has to be a ***new*** composition.\n* Moving back to our **V**, **X**, and **Z** songs, we now can deduce that **Z** has to be 6th! That’s because **Z** is a ***rock*** piece and the only ***rock*** piece out of songs 5, 6, and 7 is the 6th song.\n* So, either **V** or **X** is 5th and the other of **V** and **X** is 7th.\n* We can remove the rules that we’ve already completely incorporated into the diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nWe’ll use this main diagram as support in solving the questions. Having made so many key deductions, we should be able to save a significant amount of time and energy in finding the answers!\n","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/35eccb73d4370da8ac98e5f8f982607a09468509.png":{"height":498,"width":756},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/56b88b7a445e601b561b3eca96675dc7085505e7.png":{"height":720,"width":694},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/931660d2edc93133fd78ae5d0e91e560e1ef31a8.png":{"height":504,"width":904},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ba969fc5a4d499361fc8e2bc77a9dcadabb85147.png":{"height":558,"width":790},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ec66dca942ee4f640f9ac75dba772a915b3a9897.png":{"height":460,"width":1042}},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A mixed diagram consists of two rows.

We also need to determine the order in which the lectures are given, so that’s an ordering task. That means we are working with a **mixed setup**, and our initial diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** ***Oil paintings*** and ***watercolors*** must both be earlier than ***lithographs***. We can note the relative order with dashes and remember that we *don’t* know the relationship between ***oil*** and ***watercolors***.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Farley** must be earlier than ***oil***. We can again note this with a dash. *Normally*, we’d combine this with Rule 1 to make a bigger chain. But we can’t do that here! We don’t know if **Farley**’s lecture is the same lecture as the ***watercolor*** lecture or a different one, which makes a big difference in the deductions drawn.\n\n* **Rule 3:** **Holden**'s lecture must be earlier than both **Garcia**'s lecture and **Jiang**'s lecture. Again, we’ll note the relationships with dashes and understand that we *don’t* know the relationship between **Garcia** and **Jiang**:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* With three ordering rules, we should be able to determine a lot about where elements *can’t* go.\n* From Rule 1 we can deduce that ***oils*** *can’t* be 4th, since it’s earlier than ***lithographs***.\n* Likewise, ***watercolors*** can’t be 4th.\n* From the same rule, we know that ***lithographs*** can’t be 1st or 2nd, since ***lithographs*** is later than at least *two* other lectures.\n* From Rule 2, we can deduce that **Farley** can’t be 4th, since it’s earlier than ***oils***.\n* We can *also* deduce that **Farley** can’t be 3rd! Why? Even though we said in the previous section that we can’t combine Rules 1 and 2 in earnest, we *can* still deduce an **F**-***o-l*** chain. So, if **Farley**’s lecture were the same as the ***watercolors*** lecture, the ***lithographs*** lecture could be 3rd or 4th. But, if **Farley**’s lecture were *different* than the ***watercolors*** lecture, that would force ***lithographs*** to be 4th. Something to keep in mind.\n* Again from Rule 2, we can infer that ***oils*** can’t be 1st, since it’s later than **Farley**.\n* From Rule 3, we can deduce that **Holden** can’t be 3rd or 4th (since they’re earlier than at least two other historians), and\n* Neither **Garcia** nor **Jiang** can be 1st.\n* Here’s where we stand so far with where elements *can’t* go:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nWe could stop there if we wanted to, but it often makes sense to try to *turn negatives into positives where it makes sense to*. Meaning, since we’re only working with four historians and four topics, eliminating even a couple choices from a spot allows us to narrow that spot down in a helpful way:\n\n* **Garcia** and **Jiang** are the 3rd and 4th lecturers, in some order.\n* That means that **Farley** and **Holden** are the 1st and 2nd lecturers, in some order.\n* Either ***sculptures*** or ***watercolors*** is 1st.\n* Either ***sculptures*** or ***lithographs*** is 4th.\n* If ***lithographs*** isn’t 4th, it must be 3rd:\n\n[[☃ image 4]]\n\nThis is an excellent main diagram to head into the questions with!

Two workshops are given each day—one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. This setup involves both ordering and grouping. Here’s one way to represent this in a diagram:  \n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** **Jewelry** is in the morning, and is paired with either **Kite-making** or **Quilting**. We can add the first part of this rule directly to our diagram.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Rug-making** must be given in the afternoon, and is paired with either **Needlepoint** or **Scrapbooking**. We can add the first part of this rule directly to our diagram. \n\n* **Rule 3:** **Quilting** is given on an earlier day than both **Kite-making** and **Needlepoint**:  \n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* Since **Quilting** is on an earlier *day* than both **Kite-making** and **Needlepoint** (Rule 3), **Quilting** isn’t on Friday, and \n* **Kite-making** and **Needlepoint** aren’t on Wednesday.     \n* Since **Jewelry** is with either **Kite-making** or **Quilting**, then \n* Either **Kite-making** or **Quilting** (at least one, but maybe both) is in the afternoon.   \n* And, if either of them (**Kite-making** or **Quilting**) is in the morning, then the other one is in the afternoon, paired with **Jewelry**.   \n* Likewise, if **Needlepoint** or **Scrapbooking** is in the afternoon, then the other one is in the morning, paired with **Rug-making**.  \n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nThere may be other possible deductions, but this is a good point to get started on the questions.","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/56e331c49b1285390e9c2a5d17af7accb214bce1.png":{"height":466,"width":898},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c284ad69610bd2444e1f6c995c9df05bd6c4ee22.png":{"height":576,"width":854}},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A grouping diagram is an empty matrix.

There is a small grouping element to this setup, in that some of the excursions occur before noon, and some occur after noon. Technically, therefore, this is a mixed setup, but it might be easiest to think of it as an ordering setup, with a small twist. With this in mind, you might represent it like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** Two stops are before noon, and the rest are after noon. We’ve added this to our basic setup.\n* **Rule 2:** **Gas** is after **Tea**.\n* **Rule 3:** The **Flea market** is before the **Picnic**.\n* **Rule 4:** The **Picnic** is after the **Walk**, but before **Ice cream**. In other words, those three form a chain:  \n**W...P...I**.  \n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* First, you can combine Rules 3 and 4, as we did in the image above. can make a number of deductions about the positions of the excursions. We’ll take a look at our bigger chain first:\n* There are at least two excursions before the **Picnic**, so the **Picnic** can’t be 1st or 2nd.\n* There is also at least one excursion *after* the **Picnic**, so the **Picnic** also can’t be 6th.\n* There are least three excursions before **Ice cream**, so **Ice cream** can’t be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.  **Ice cream** is 4th *at the earliest*.\n* The **Flea market** can’t be 5th or 6th, because it is followed by at least two activities.\n* The **Walk** can’t be 5th or 6th, because it’s followed by **Picnic** and **Ice cream** at minimum.\n\nWhat about the smaller chain?\n\n* From Rule 2 we can deduce that **Gas** isn’t 1st and **Tea** isn’t 6th.\n* Since there are only six excursions, this means that only **Gas** or **Ice cream** could be last. It likely isn’t worth it to build scenarios, since knowing which one is 6th doesn’t lead to further deductions from there. Here’s our full initial diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nThere may be other deductions we can make, but this is a good point at which to get started on the questions.","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1ba9fbdac2d64519b5323c490638e31bc6c1e7c7.png":{"height":383,"width":800},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cf15fd84c19ff15c4c2a967d92c3247a88f621e0.png":{"height":320,"width":800},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/df4d716bbebacb17bc419ac74c794231c3b0ddff.png":{"height":547,"width":800}},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"An ordering diagram has horizontal bars over the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

A basic “in/out” diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nFor the purposes of simplicity, we’ll refer to the bowls by the name of their potters—for example, “**Mills** must be 4th.” \n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** If **Larsen** is in, **Mills** is out. This is conditional logic, and it also means that if **Mills** is in, then **Larsen** is out.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Park** can be in only if it is next to **Oliver** and next to **Serra**—in other words, if **Park**is in, then it’s between **Oliver** and **Serra** in some order. \n\n* **Rule 3:** **Reigel** can be displayed only in either position 1 or position 6. In a classic ordering setup, we would likely draw an arrow from **Reigel** to the 1st and 6th positions. However, since there’s an “Out” column to consider, it could be more helpful to simply show that **Reigel** *can’t* be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n* **Rule 4:** **Serra** cannot be displayed in either position 2 or position 4. We can mark this directly into the diagram under positions 2 and 4.\n\n* **Rule 5:** **Neiman** can be displayed only in position 5. That means that **Neiman** is either 5th or out, so we can mark this directly into the diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* The first rule essentially means that **Larsen** and **Mills** can’t both be displayed. \n* So, we can reserve a spot in the “Out” column for **Larsen** or **Mills**.\n* It’s *critical* to note that they *could* both be *out*...they just can’t both be *in*. So, we can’t deduce that at least one of them is in—only that *at least* one of them is out.\n* The second rule tells us that if **Park** is in, then we’ll see either the group **OPS** or **SPO** in the display. What can we deduce from this?\n* We can deduce that **Park** *can’t* be in positions 1 or 6. If it were, it wouldn’t be able to be *between* **Serra** and **Oliver** the way the rule states.\n* Since Rule 4 already told us that **Serra** can’t be 2nd or 4th, then we can deduce that **Park** *also* can’t be 3rd! There wouldn’t be any way for it to be next to **Serra** if it were 3rd.\n* So, the options for **Park** have become somewhat limited: either **Park** is 2nd, 4th, 5th, or Out.\n* Four scenarios is usually too many to make it worth your time to build Multiple Scenarios, given the time constraints on Test Day. The exception might be if you can build them very quickly and make fast and copious deductions for each one.\n* Likewise, if we consider building Multiple Scenarios around **Neiman** being restricted to either spot 5 or out, we quickly find that expanding those Scenarios out doesn’t really further our deductions in an appreciable way.\n* A different aspect of Rule 2 is intriguing, however: if **Park** is in, then we’ll see **OPS** or **SPO** in the display. Let’s combine that with our deduction that **L/M** is taking up one of the *Out* spots—which means that there’s only one more *Out* spot left. Who could occupy it?\n* It *can’t* be **Olivera** or **Serra**! Why? If **Olivera** or **Serra** were out, then **Park** would *also* have to be out, since the **OPS** or **SPO** grouping would no longer be possible! \n* So, we can make a note directly in the Out column that **Olivera** and **Serra** *can’t* be Out.\n* The number of bowls that *can* still be out is too high to make it useful to pursue this deduction any further.\n\nWe can move to the questions with this main diagram, and expect that some of the questions will give us new conditions to consider:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/35eccb73d4370da8ac98e5f8f982607a09468509.png":{"height":498,"width":756},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/56b88b7a445e601b561b3eca96675dc7085505e7.png":{"height":720,"width":694},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/931660d2edc93133fd78ae5d0e91e560e1ef31a8.png":{"height":504,"width":904},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ba969fc5a4d499361fc8e2bc77a9dcadabb85147.png":{"height":558,"width":790},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ec66dca942ee4f640f9ac75dba772a915b3a9897.png":{"height":460,"width":1042}},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A mixed diagram contains an ordering diagram plus an Out grouping column.

The setup indicates that some jobs take a half a day, while others take a full day. This means that there is a small grouping element to this setup, but it might be easiest to think of this as an ordering task.\n\nNote that we are *not* told that every day has a job. For example, if each job takes a half day, then it's very possible that at least one day doesn't have any jobs. Therefore, it's best to not draw any spots until we know where they go; our basic diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n* **Rule 1:** **N** is on the same day as **S**, so we can think of them as a pair: **NS**.  \n* **Rule 2:** **X** is on Wednesday, and **T** is on Friday. We can add this directly to our diagram.  \n* **Rule 3:** **S** is on an earlier day than **P**.  \n* **Rule 4:** **U** and **X** are the only jobs that *must* take an entire day each. In other words, **X** and **U** are *alone* on their days, although it's important to note that a different job could *also* be alone, but it would have to be a half day. We can close Wednesday off with double lines in our diagram, since it's now full.\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n**What can we deduce from the rules?**\n\n* Since **X** is on Wednesday and **T** is on Friday, the **NS** pair is on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday.  \n* **S** is earlier than **P**. Since **NS** is a pair, this means that **N** is also earlier than **P**, and  \n* **P** can't be on Monday.   \n* **U** has to be on its own, so it isn’t on Wednesday or Friday.  \n* Since **U** and **X** take up an entire day by themselves, we can now deduce that there *is* at least one job on each of the days. If you can't see that clearly, try counting: since all of the other jobs must be half-days, then there can only be a maximum of two jobs per day. Now that **X** and **U** take two days off of the table, there are only *three days* left to accommodate *five* half-day jobs!\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nThere may be other deductions we can make, but this is a good point at which to start the questions.","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1a6c8f3f118851c8bf4c9ad1dec6859f399ecb3b.png":{"height":452,"width":584},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6389920de33c9353836af5c5669ee126ac14d4c2.png":{"height":298,"width":720},"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b8498be5c152af8ce5cbc727b11ee49d1747c385.png":{"height":734,"width":834}},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"An ordering diagram is a table with five columns and an initial diagram.
