When a distribution contains an odd number of numbers, the median is equal to the number in the middle.\n\nThis means if we count off the dots from left to right, the $5$th dot would represent the median because there would be $4$ numbers before it and $4$ after it.\n\nUsing the first dotplot as an example, the numbers are:\n\n$1$, $2$, $2$, $3$, $\\blueD{3}$, $3$, $4$, $4$, $5$\n\nThe median is $\\blueD{3}$. In fact, the medians of all five distributions are $\\blueD{3}$.\n\n__Comparing the Mean__\n\nThe mean of a distribution is equal to the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers.\n\nSince we are comparing the mean of each distribution to $\\blueD3$, we can think about the mean in relation to $\\blueD3$.\n\nOne way to do that is to sort the numbers in the distributions into groups with means of $\\blueD3$:\n\n* $\\blueD3$s: the mean of $\\blueD{3}$s is $\\blueD3$.\n* $\\greenD2$-$\\greenD4$ pairs: the mean of $\\greenD2$ and $\\greenD4$ is $\\blueD3$.\n* $\\purpleC1$-$\\purpleC5$ pairs: the mean of $\\purpleC1$ and $\\purpleC5$ is $\\blueD3$.\n\n![](web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/fadc87b1c6a1af2c73e4fb1b40280df7f90550b5)\n\nAs long as the distribution consists of only $\\blueD3$s, $\\greenD2$-$\\greenD4$ pairs, and $\\purpleC1$-$\\purpleC5$ pairs, the mean of the distribution is $\\blueD3$.\n\nPractically, this means when we cross off all the $\\blueD3$s, $\\greenD2$-$\\greenD4$ pairs, and $\\purpleC1$-$\\purpleC5$ pairs, the mean of the *remaining* numbers will tell us about the mean of the entire distribution:\n\n* If no numbers remain, then the mean of the entire distribution is $\\blueD3$.\n* If the mean of the remaining numbers is less than $\\blueD3$, then the mean of the entire distribution is less than $\\blueD3$.\n* If the mean of the remaining numbers is greater than $\\blueD3$, then the mean of the entire distribution is greater than $\\blueD3$.\n\nWe are looking for a distribution in which the mean of the remaining numbers is greater than $\\blueD3$.\n\n![](web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/5344e394e984daead9a16d8c833faad01770447c)\n\nIn the third dotplot, $2$ and $5$ remain. Since the mean of $2$ and $5$ is $\\dfrac{2+5}{2}=3.5$, the mean of the distribution is greater than the median, $\\blueD3$. \n\n__Confirming Mathematically__\n\n\nWe can confirm our choice by calculating the mean of the entire distribution:\n\n$\\begin{align}\n\\text{mean}\u0026=\\dfrac{1+2+2+3+3+3+4+5+5}{9} \\\\\\\\\n\u0026=\\dfrac{28}{9} \\\\\\\\\n\u0026=3\\dfrac{1}{9}\n\\end{align}$\n\n$3\\dfrac{1}{9}\u003e3$, so the mean is indeed greater than the median.\n\n**The following distribution has a mean greater than its median:**\n\n![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3ecb84f5875d7c39da2abf912f222dc81daf07e2.png)","images":{"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3ecb84f5875d7c39da2abf912f222dc81daf07e2.png":{"height":101,"width":344},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/1fdea0355908e05f023c8e78a365a8422123f89b":{"height":143,"width":333},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/5344e394e984daead9a16d8c833faad01770447c":{"height":143,"width":333},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/f23c7aa6056e2daddf3e57aef99d06a966f66a42":{"height":143,"width":333},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/fadc87b1c6a1af2c73e4fb1b40280df7f90550b5":{"height":143,"width":333}},"replace":false,"widgets":{}}],"keepInMind":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"overview":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"question":{"__type":"content","content":"Which of the following dotplots represents a distribution of nine values of $x$ in which the mean of the distribution is greater than the median of the distribution?\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n","images":{},"widgets":{"radio 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"clue":"The mean of this distribution, $3$, is equal to the median of the distribution, $3$.","content":"![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccf74342b1b73210481be2219ed22c8a2d50ecc0.png)","correct":false},{"clue":"The mean of this distribution, $2.\\overline{8}$, is less than the median of the distribution, $3$.","content":"![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3b471d5703477a25b9e8888b7eb11b9b88285d8.png)","correct":false},{"clue":"The mean of this distribution, $3.\\overline{1}$, is greater than the median of the distribution, $3$.","content":"![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3ecb84f5875d7c39da2abf912f222dc81daf07e2.png)","correct":true,"isNoneOfTheAbove":false},{"clue":"The mean of this distribution, $2.\\overline{7}$, is less than the median of the distribution, $3$.","content":"![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5170f2b7b5ef9b19d24070b1a111e98ae9d42788.png)","correct":false,"isNoneOfTheAbove":false},{"clue":"The mean of this distribution, $3$, is equal to the median of the distribution, $3$.","content":"![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9fd58949ab60cbf04b10c4fec2e58ab3ebbaf931.png)","correct":false,"isNoneOfTheAbove":false}],"countChoices":false,"deselectEnabled":false,"displayCount":null,"hasNoneOfTheAbove":false,"multipleSelect":false,"randomize":false},"static":false,"type":"radio","version":{"major":1,"minor":0}}}}}},"item_shape_type":"gtp-single-question","key":"bb8dcd4dd7ad93587ae70c7b53d678f9a7a39322","name":"Item 34 (VF648884)","perseus_api_major_version":3,"requires_screen_or_mouse":false,"sha":"bb8dcd4dd7ad93587ae70c7b53d678f9a7a39322","tags":["5823458042707968","5811972226416640"]},{"author_key":"None","author_names":["amy skerry"],"content_id":"x5f63fd1d4ab04074","content_kind":"AssessmentItem","content_kind_code":"i","created_by":"Key('UserData', 'user_id_key_http://id.khanacademy.org/662aa57f073d4165910fc4856d7aa5e5')","creation_date":"2018-11-05 19:47:57.901907","do_not_publish":false,"hide":false,"id":"x5f63fd1d4ab04074","imported_from_sha":"","item_data":{"_multi":{"blurb":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"hints":[{"__type":"hint","content":"We can translate the relationship between $P$ and $Q$ and the relationship between $Q$ and $R$ into equations, then use substitution to relate $P$ to $R$.\n\n$P$ is $6$ times $Q$ translates to:\n\n$P=6Q$\n\n$Q$ is $2$ less than $9$ times $R$ translates to:\n\n$Q=9R-2$\n\nTo relate $P$ and $R$, we can substitute $9R-2$ for $Q$ in the first equation:\n\n$\\begin{align}\nP\u0026=6Q \\\\\\\\\n\u0026=6(9R-2) \\\\\\\\\n\u0026=54R-12 \n\\end{align}$\n\nFinally, we can translate $P=54R-12$ into a sentence:\n\n**$P$ is $12$ less than $54$ times $R$.**","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{}}],"keepInMind":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"overview":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"question":{"__type":"content","content":"$P$ is $6$ times $Q$, and $Q$ is $2$ less than $9$ times $R$.

The number of data points stays the same so the change in mean is due only to the change in the sum of the data.  After the data change, the sum of data increases by* $-3-3+7+9=10$.  *Therefore the __change__ in mean is equal to the __change__ in the sum of data divided by the number of data points,* $\\dfrac{10}{20}=0.5$.\n\n\n**__Median__**\n\nThe median of a list of numbers is the middle value when the numbers are arranged from least to greatest.  If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two values in the middle.\n\nPutting  the $20$ numbers from each dataset into a  list ordered from least to greatest,  notice that the $10$th and $11$th numbers are in the middle—nine values lie on either side.\n\nOriginal Data: $3$, $3$, $4$, $4$, $4$, $4$, $5$, $5$, $5$, $\\blueD{6}$, $\\blueD{6}$, $6$, $6$, $6$, $7$, $7$, $8$, $8$, $8$, $9$\n\nChanged Data: $4$, $4$, $4$, $4$, $5$, $5$, $5$, $6$, $6$, $\\blueD{6}$, $\\blueD{6}$, $6$, $7$, $7$, $7$, $8$, $8$, $8$, $9$, $9$\n\nIn both datasets the middle points ($10$th and $11$th numbers ) have a value of $\\blueD{6}$.  \n\nSo, for both datasets the median is $6$ since $\\dfrac{\\left(6+6\\right)}{2}=6$.\n\nTherefore, the median does not change. \n\n*Note: When finding the median, it is helpful to see the dot plot stated as a list.  However, when there are many dots making a list can take a lot of time.  In these cases, find the middle of the data on the dot plot itself.*\n\n\n**The mean would increase by $0.5$, and the median would not change.**","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{}}],"keepInMind":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"overview":{"__type":"content","content":"","images":{},"widgets":{}},"question":{"__type":"content","content":"![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e81707a125414e088e1497973896b5daf41df190.png)\n\nThe dot plot above shows $20$ integer values of variable $x$, from $3$ to $9$, inclusive.
