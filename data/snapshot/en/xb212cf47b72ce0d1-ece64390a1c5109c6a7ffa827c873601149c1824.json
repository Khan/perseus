At first glance, it might seem like we need to group the individual participants, but that ends up being descriptive background info that won’t affect our diagram. We are **ordering** **Judges**, **Lawyers**, **Medical**, **Nurses**, **Police**, and **Teachers**. Since the six groups will be evaluated separately and one after the other, your initial diagram might look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** The **Teachers** are at some time before the **Medical doctors** and at some time before the **Nurses**. We can note this *relative* ordering using dashes. Keep in mind that we don’t know 1) how much actual time separates the elements, and 2) what the relationship is between **Medical doctors** and **Nurses**.\n\n* **Rule 2:** The **Medical doctors** are at some time before the **Lawyers**. Again, we can note this rule down. Some students like to combine rules as they go, so they might note this rule as an attachment to Rule 1; for simplicity’s sake, we’ll keep all of the rules separate until we get to the Deductions stage.\n\n* **Rule 3:** The **Nurses** are either immediately before or immediately after the **Police**. This rule *does* tell us about actual spacing, so we can mark it **NP or PN**. \n\n* **Rule 4:** The **Police** are at some time between the **Judges** and the **Lawyers**, but we *don’t* know the relative order of the **Judges** and **Lawyers**, so we can create another “or” statement:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nAll of our rules involve Groups of elements! So, we can definitely look for Repeat elements and connect rules that way, creating bigger and bigger groups. But first: we have an ideal opportunity to create Multiple Scenarios from Rule 4. Either **J—P—L** is true, or **L—P—J** is true, and from there, we can build out each scenario further using the other rules’ Groups. \n\n**Scenario 1:** **J—P—L**\n\n* Rule 3 tells us that **NP** is a pair, but we’ll want to make sure we remember that it could be **NP** *or* **PN**. There are a number of ways to mark this; we’ll show you two and you can choose the one that seems clearer to you.\n* We can add Rule 2 (**M—L**) to the **Lawyers** we’ve already marked.\n* We can also add Rule 1 (**T—M**) and attach it to the **M** here.\n* Likewise, we know that **T—N**, so we can note that dash to complete this scenario:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n**Scenario 2:** **L—P—J**\n\n* In this scenario, we can once again add **N** in order to make the **PN** or **NP** pair. Again, we’ll show you two different ways to note this.\n* We’ll add Rule 2 (**M—L**), and\n* We’ll add Rule 1 (**T—M**).\n* Note that we don’t need to connect **T** and **N**, since this scenario’s diagram already makes it clear that **T** is earlier than **N**:\n\n[[☃ image 4]]\n\nWe’ll opt for the first way of noting the **PN** or **NP** pair for the remainder of these explanations. Our final diagram looks like this:\n\n[[☃ image 5]]\n\nThe Multiple Scenarios make our job a lot easier: every acceptable situation that conforms to this setup’s rules will fit into one of these two scenarios! And if you have a “new-if” question that places an element into a specific spot, you can use the dashed diagram that we initially came up with if it’s not already clear from our Scenarios what the answer is. \n\n**Important note:** These dashes represent *relative* ordering. If two elements are not connected in a linear way, we cannot deduce their relationship. For example, in Scenario 1, we have no way of knowing whether **Judges** or **Medical doctors** are earlier! So, don’t be “visual” when interpreting these diagrams—don’t assume that “farther left” means “earlier”. Use the dashes to understand what relationships we know and what relationships we don’t know. If it’s helpful to you, many students like to pretend that the dashes are “stretchy” so that they don’t fall into the trap of interpreting the diagrams visually.\n\nLet’s tackle the questions using our final diagram.\n","widgets":{"image 24":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5eb24afad9bf4b42e3a3e2f3310e7861b8408d63.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 23":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/99beeb19e60e98d6226bdf90d8fcff5cd3b98d3c.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 22":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/694643856d610c7f6d86504ffe18dd2fcce6f133.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 21":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c26a3387c13ff60698472c9fcd9a5708002199f2.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 20":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/29b769b62e5ea3caacfa5738f00ed074fb31afca.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"A vertical list of elements and three scenarios that are mixed diagrams.\n\nA list of elements consists of capital initials with a subscript next to each.

There is no grouping component to this setup. Your basic diagram might look like this:\n\n\n[[☃ image 21]]\n\n###What the rules tell us\n\n* **Rule 1:** **Pizza** is sometime before **Granola**. We’ll use a dash to convey the *relative* order of these two commercials, though we don’t know how much space actually separates them.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Sportswear** is sometime before **Truck**. Again, we can note this to the side using a dash.\n\n* **Rule 3:** **Fast-food** and **Sportswear** must be aired consecutively, so the pair is **FS** or **SF**, since we don’t know the order:\n\n[[☃ image 22]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* One thing we can do is to make the **SF** or **FS** pair bigger by detecting the Repeat between Rules 2 and 3: **Sportswear** is in both rules. So, we can note this:\n\n[[☃ image 23]]\n\n* At this point, our two chains (**P—G** and **SF—T or FS—T**) don’t have anything in common.\n* However, we don’t have to move to the questions too hastily!\n* If we had, let’s say, eight elements for eight spots, and this is all we had to work with, we might make some deductions as to where elements can’t go, and move on to the questions.\n* But, with a very limited number of spots (five), and a chain that already represents three of the five commercials, it makes sense to take the time to create Multiple Scenarios.\n* We’ll build three Scenarios around the **SF**/**FS** pair, since they are the most concrete and thus are the most limited in where they can go:\n\n[[☃ image 24]]\n\nIn each scenario, we only have three more spots to fill! It’s helpful to think of these kinds of real estate limitations on Test Day.\n\n**Scenario 1:** **Fast-food** and **Sportswear** are 1st and 2nd.\n\n* In this case, we can deduce that **Granola** *can’t* be 3rd (since it has to have at least **Pizza** before it), so either **Pizza** or **Truck** must be 3rd.\n* Likewise, **Pizza**can’t be last (Rule 1), so the 5th spot must be either **Granola** or **Truck**.\n\n**Scenario 2:** **Fast-food** and **Sportswear** are 2nd and 3rd.\n\n* Here, **Granola** can’t be 1st (Rule 1) and **Truck** can’t be 1st (Rule 2), so\n* We can deduce that **Pizza** must be 1st.\n* That means that **Granola** and **Truck** are 4th and 5th, in some order.\n\n**Scenario 3:** **Fast-food** and **Sportswear** are 3rd and 4th.\n\n* In this scenario, **Truck** *has* to be 5th (Rule 2).\n* That means that **Pizza** must be 1st (Rule 1) and\n* **Granola** must be 2nd (Rule 2):\n\n[[☃ image 25]]\n\nScenarios take more time to build up front, but they should allow us to be much more accurate *and* efficient in the questions. Every situation that conforms to the rules will fall into one of these scenarios, so we should be able to understand much more of what is possible and what must be true/false, now that we have Multiple Scenarios to work with.","widgets":{"image 26":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fbc3629635a95e945c0f7d858dc7c875979d7cec.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 25":{"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[800,465],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fbc3629635a95e945c0f7d858dc7c875979d7cec.png","width":800,"height":465},"labels":[],"alt":"Final diagram.

On top of that, each week will include two paintings, one **oil** and one **watercolor**, so that’s a **grouping** component. That means we have a **mixed setup**. Note the way the numbers don’t line up neatly in this setup! There are three **oil** and three **watercolor** for *eight* spots. So, we can make an early deduction that **one of each type of painting will repeat exactly once**. An initial diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n* We’re choosing to use subscripts for the **oil** and **watercolor** paintings, since the introduction tells us exactly which elements are **oil** and which are **watercolor**. It can often be easier than constantly referring to a list to remember which ones are which. \n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** No painting can be shown in two consecutive weeks. Note this however it makes sense to you. We like a rectangle with a slash through it, using **X** to designate any given painting.\n\n* **Rule 2:** ***Gold-o*** cannot be shown in any week in which ***Ping-w*** is shown. It helps to pay attention to **oil** versus **watercolor**! Since our diagram has **oil** above **watercolor** in each week, it’s a great idea to keep this rule in the same orientation (vertical, with **oil** on top) as the diagram.\n\n* **Rule 3:** ***Hanbok-o*** must be shown in any week in which ***Sails-w*** is shown. **Careful!** This *doesn’t* mean that **HS** is always a pair! It only means that *if* ***Sails-w*** is shown, *then* ***Hanbok-o*** is paired with it. But ***Hanbok-o*** could *also* be paired with a different painting. [If this feels like a challenging concept, make sure to visit [Khan Academy’s Conditional Logic articles in the Logic Toolbox](/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/logic-toolbox-new/a/logic-toolbox--article--conditional-reasoning-logical-equivalence)!] So, we can note the rule down using conditional logic, as well as its logically equivalent rule that if ***Hanbok-o*** *isn’t* shown, then ***Sails-w*** *isn’t* shown that week.\n\n* **Rule 4:** ***Hanbok-o*** cannot be shown earlier than the third week unless ***Ibex-o*** is shown in the first week. Here’s another conditional logic rule. It means that if ***Hanbok-o*** is 1st or 2nd, then ***Ibex-o*** is 1st; and by that logic, if ***Ibex-o*** is *not* 1st, then ***Hanbok-o*** must be 3rd or 4th:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* Rule 4 is intriguing, because both ***Hanbok-o*** and ***Ibex-o*** are **oil** paintings. So it isn’t possible to say that if ***Hanbok-o*** is 1st, ***Ibex-o*** is also 1st.\n* That means that we can deduce that ***Hanbok-o*** is never 1st! Let’s note that directly in the diagram.\n* We can also modify the conditional logic and remove the condition regarding ***Hanbok-o*** in 1st.\n* Let’s stay with ***Hanbok-o*** for the moment, since it’s a Repeat element from Rule 2. \n* We know from Rule 2 that if ***Hanbok-o*** is not shown, then ***Sails-w*** can’t be shown.\n* That means that ***Sails-w*** *also* can’t be 1st! \n* There’s a lot to keep track of here, but not too many more deductions we could make, so let’s move to the questions using this main diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n","widgets":{"image 23":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3b2aac510a72cacda97ceb265b6a1f2c0e61ffbb.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 22":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fc96a361b37f07d1126be5b8f7a95ea3813832ef.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 21":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9ea262a3d6fa7145b2d225f5a225c564bbe74319.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 20":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/29b769b62e5ea3caacfa5738f00ed074fb31afca.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"A vertical list of elements and three scenarios that are mixed diagrams.\n\nA list of elements consists of capital initials with a subscript next to each.

That means we’re **grouping** volunteers into days (a group of 3 on each day). That gives us a total of nine volunteer spots to be filled by five volunteers. Numbers are important, especially when they don’t line up well! We’ll keep in mind that at least someone repeats at least once, and hopefully we get more restrictions on the numbers later on. Our initial diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** No volunteer works every day. We can note this near the diagram. This will have implications on how the numbers work out when we make our deductions.\n\n* **Rule 2:** On any day that Morse works, Lentz also works. This *doesn’t* mean that **ML** is a pair! It means that *if* **Morse** works, **Lentz** also works. But **Lentz** could work without **Morse**. So, we can note the conditional logic and its equivalent logic, which is that any day that **Lentz** *doesn’t* work, **Morse** *doesn’t* work.\n\n* **Rule 3:** **Nuñez** works on Friday. We can note this directly into the diagram.\n\n* **Rule 4:** **Pang** does not work on Saturday. We can note this in the diagram next to the Saturday row:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* Since no volunteer can work all three days, each volunteer must work either once or twice. That limits us in a much more helpful way than the introductory paragraph initially did!\n* We can deduce that each volunteer must work twice, *except* for one volunteer who works only once. We can update our rule to reflect this.\n* Since our numbers are so limited, we have a pretty good opportunity to build Multiple Scenarios around **Morse**. \n* **Morse** *has* to work at least once, and there are only three total days in the setup, *and* **Morse** always brings **Lentz** along, so let’s try building three Scenarios, in which **Morse** and **Lentz** are on a different day:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nKeep in mind that **ML** could work more than once! These Scenarios don’t assume that they can’t. But what the Scenarios accomplish is creating three situations into which *every* acceptable (rules-conforming) situation possible *will* fall. Let’s make deductions for each Scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1:** **ML** work on Thursday.\n\n* There isn’t much we could deduce here. It’s too open-ended. Let’s move to Scenario 2.\n\n**Scenario 2:** **ML** work on Friday.\n\n* This is easier to work with, since **Nuñez** already works on Friday, which means that Friday is now full.\n* Since **Pang** can’t work on Saturday (Rule 4), **Pang** has to work on Thursday.\n* That also means that **Pang** is the one employee who works only once!\n* So, in this case, **ML** must work on Saturday as well as on Friday. Why?\n* If **ML** worked on Thursday and Friday in this scenario, that would leave three spots on Saturday to fill. Neither **M** nor **L** can work all three days (Rule 1), so only **Nuñez** and **Quinn** would be left to fill those three Saturday spots. \n* Since we can’t fill three spots with two people, **ML** must work Saturday.\n* That leaves **Nuñez** and **Quinn** to be the remaining two Thursday workers.\n* So, **Quinn** must be the third Saturday worker so that **Nuñez** isn’t working every day (Rule 1).\n* This scenario is completely determined!\n\n**Scenario 3:** **ML** work on Saturday.\n\n* In this case, either **Nuñez** or **Quinn** is with **ML** on Saturday, since **Pang** can’t be (Rule 4).\n* We can’t deduce much more here:\n\n[[☃ image 4]]\n\nIt’s often the case with Multiple Scenarios that one scenario will be much more complete than the other(s). What’s important is that we were able to make *some* additional deductions after breaking the setup into Scenarios. We should be able to use this final diagram to help us answer the questions more quickly and accurately.","widgets":{"image 24":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/df6286ceb05fe2feccbc08d67b1de144ae6456bd.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 23":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1486e00bff2e8f15c5c0f8d8607c73316c81a713.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 22":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/24152db2368d6b771e4a178051ec46ce189e70af.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 21":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8cdd20adb4e5bee3375313a5fbe275e5bd123d0c.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"","caption":""},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 20":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[400,400],"backgroundImage":{"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/29b769b62e5ea3caacfa5738f00ed074fb31afca.png"},"labels":[],"alt":"A vertical list of elements and three scenarios that are mixed diagrams.\n\nA list of elements consists of capital initials with a subscript next to each.
