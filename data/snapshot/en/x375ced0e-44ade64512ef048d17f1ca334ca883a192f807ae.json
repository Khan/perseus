There is a green segment from point two, seven to point five, one.","backgroundImage":{"height":325,"url":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/421a39d99b05e869d34d0ae5c4c2b6bb4038bed2","width":325},"box":[325,325],"caption":"","labels":[],"range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"static":false,"title":""},"static":false,"type":"image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},"images":{},"title":"Problem 4","widgets":{"interactive-graph 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"backgroundImage":{"bottom":0,"height":425,"left":0,"scale":1,"url":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/3765d2bb8ec634df19335f37c2760a14dc0d5396","width":425},"correct":{"coords":[[[1,5],[7,2]]],"type":"segment"},"graph":{"type":"segment"},"gridStep":[1,1],"labels":["x","y"],"markings":"none","range":[[-10,10],[-10,10]],"rulerLabel":"","rulerTicks":10,"showProtractor":false,"showRuler":false,"showTooltips":false,"snapStep":[1,1],"step":[1,1]},"static":false,"type":"interactive-graph","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},"static":false,"type":"graded-group","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},{"content":"##Why study inverses?\n\nIt may seem arbitrary to be interested in inverse functions but in fact we use them all the time! \n\nConsider that the equation $C=\\dfrac59(F-32)$ can be used to convert the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, $F$, to a temperature in degrees Celsius, $C$.  \n\nBut suppose we wanted an equation that did the reverse – that converted a temperature in degrees Celsius to a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  This describes the function $F=\\dfrac95C+32$, or the inverse function.  \n\nOn a more basic level, we solve many equations in mathematics, by \"isolating the variable\".  When we isolate the variable, we \"undo\" what is around it.  In this way, we are using the idea of inverse functions to solve equations.","images":{},"widgets":{}}]
