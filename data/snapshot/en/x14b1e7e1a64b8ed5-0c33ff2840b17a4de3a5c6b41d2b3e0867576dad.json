We usually ignore any resistance from the wires.  \n\n[[☃ image 7]]\n\nIn a simple circuit, the voltage supplied by the battery $ε$ is the voltage expended by the resistor $R$, and there is only one current $I$ in the circuit.\n\n###Closed circuit \n\nA closed circuit has a continuous pathway for current to flow through. In other words, there are no gaps in the circuit.\n\n[[☃ image 8]]\n\n###Open circuit\n\nAn open circuit has a gap in the circuit that does not allow current to flow through. The gap can be caused by an open switch, a broken component, or broken wire.\n\n[[☃ image 9]]\n\n###Short circuit \n\nA short is a pathway of zero resistance within a circuit (see the blue wire in Figure 9).  When there is a short circuit, all the current flows across the short because the current prefers the path of least resistance.\n\n[[☃ image 10]]\n\nFigure 10 below shows how closing a switch $S$ can divert all the current from resistor $R_2$. When switch $S$ is open (see Figure 10A), the current $I$ flows out of the positive terminal of the battery towards node $N$. Since the switch is open, no current flows through the switch and all the current flows through resistor $R_2$.  When the switch is closed (see Figure 10B), it forms a short around resistor $R_2$.  Now, once the current $I$ reaches $N$, the current bypasses $R_2$ and flows through the switch.\n\n[[☃ image 11]]","images":{},"widgets":{"image 10":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"","backgroundImage":{"height":210,"url":"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4e4c89331014e694b5f57b603c553fa34142c650.png","width":172},"box":[172,210],"caption":"Figure 9.
