Graphically speaking,  a function is even when it is symmetric about the $y$-axis.\n\nA function $f$ is odd when $f(-x)=-f(x)$ **for all** values of $x$. Graphically speaking, odd functions appear the same when we reflect them once about the $y$-axis *and then* reflect them about the $x$-axis (and vice-versa).","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{}},{"content":"###Verification\n\nReflecting the curve about the $y$-axis doesn't give back the original curve, which you can verify for yourself by dragging the point on the $x$-axis from right to left.
