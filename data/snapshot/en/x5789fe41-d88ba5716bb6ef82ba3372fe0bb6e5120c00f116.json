Let's analyze the intervals where it's positive in two steps.\n\nBelow is a drawing of the $x$-axis with three points marked on it (not drawn to scale).\n\n**Step 1. Match each of the polynomial's zeros, in order, to the three points.**\n\n[[☃ label-image 1]]\n\nThe zeros define four intervals.\n\n- Interval $A$ is everything to the left of the smallest zero.\n- Intervals $B$ and $C$ are the intervals between subsequent zeros.\n- Interval $D$ is everything to the right of the largest zero.\n\n**Step 2. Pick all the intervals where $f$ is positive.**\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"label-image 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"choices":["$-4$","$-\\dfrac32$","$0$","$\\dfrac32$","$4$"],"hideChoicesFromInstructions":true,"imageAlt":"","imageHeight":80,"imageUrl":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/3448f134725f2c374d3fa2027cdb599346639f33","imageWidth":380,"markers":[{"answers":[],"label":"","x":24.4,"y":47.8},{"answers":[],"label":"","x":49.7,"y":49.2},{"answers":[],"label":"","x":75,"y":47.8}],"multipleAnswers":false,"static":false},"static":false,"type":"label-image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"radio 1":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"$A$","correct":true},{"content":"$B$","correct":false},{"content":"$C$","correct":true,"isNoneOfTheAbove":false},{"content":"$D$","correct":false,"isNoneOfTheAbove":false}],"countChoices":false,"deselectEnabled":false,"displayCount":null,"hasNoneOfTheAbove":false,"multipleSelect":true,"randomize":false},"static":false,"type":"radio","version":{"major":1,"minor":0}}}}},"item_shape_type":"item","key":"913dc2bc9c23f903ea17ef35acd7d6615cd183fb","name":"Alternative to find positive interval","perseus_api_major_version":10,"requires_screen_or_mouse":false,"sha":"913dc2bc9c23f903ea17ef35acd7d6615cd183fb","tags":[]}]
