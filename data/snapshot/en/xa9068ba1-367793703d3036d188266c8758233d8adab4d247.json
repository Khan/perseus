A crowd of admiring spectators watches as Kingman squeezes dollops of paint from several tubes into a tin watercolor [[1]] __box, from just a few primary colors,__ Kingman creates dozens of beautiful hues as he layers the translucent paint onto the paper on his easel. Each stroke of the brush and dab of the sponge transforms thinly sketched outlines into buildings, shop signs, and streetlamps. The street scene Kingman begins composing in this short film is very much in keeping with the urban landscapes for which he is best known.\n\n[1] Kingman was keenly interested in landscape painting from an early age. [2] In Hong Kong, where Kingman completed his schooling, teachers at that time customarily assigned students a formal “school name.” [3] His interest was so keen, in fact, that he was named after it. [4] The young boy who had been called Dong Moy Shu became Dong Kingman. [5] The name Kingman was selected for its two [[2]] __parts, “king” and “man”;__ Cantonese for “scenery” and “composition.” [6] As Kingman developed as a painter, his works were often compared to [[3]] __paintings by Chinese landscape artists__ dating back to CE 960, a time when a strong tradition of landscape painting emerged in Chinese art. [7] Kingman, however, [[4]] __vacated__ from that tradition in a number of ways, most notably in that he chose to focus not on natural landscapes, such as mountains and rivers, but on cities. [[5]] \n\n[[6]] His fine brushwork conveys detailed street-level activity: a  peanut vendor pushing his cart on the sidewalk, a pigeon pecking for crumbs around a fire hydrant, an old man tending to a baby outside a doorway. His broader brushstrokes and sponge-painted shapes create majestic city skylines, with skyscrapers towering in the background, bridges connecting neighborhoods on either side of a river, and enormous ships maneuvering out of a busy harbor. To art critics and fans alike, these city scenes represent the innovative spirit of twentieth-century urban Modernism. \n\nDuring his career, Kingman exhibited his work [[7]] __internationally. He garnered__ much acclaim. In 1936, a critic described one of Kingman’s solo exhibits as “twenty of the freshest, most satisfying watercolors that have been seen hereabouts in many a day.” Since Kingman’s death in 2000, museums across the United States and in China have continued to ensure that his now-iconic landscapes remain available for the public to enjoy.", "passageTitle": "Dong Kingman: Painter of Cities",

A bike-sharing program is adopted to encourage nonmotorized transportation. Stoplight timing is coordinated to alleviate rush hour traffic jams in a congested downtown area. When any one of these changes [[1]] __occur, it is__ likely the result of careful analysis conducted by transportation planners.\n\nThe work of transportation planners generally includes evaluating current transportation needs, assessing the effectiveness of existing facilities, and improving those facilities or [[2]] __they design__ new ones. Most transportation planners work in or near cities, but some are employed in rural areas. Say, for example, a large factory is built on the outskirts of a small town. Traffic to and from that location would increase at the beginning and end of work shifts. The transportation planner’s job might involve conducting a traffic count to determine the daily number of vehicles traveling on the road to the new factory. If analysis of the traffic count indicates that there is more traffic than the [[3]] __current road as it is designed at this time__ can efficiently accommodate, the transportation planner might recommend widening the road to add another lane.\n\nTransportation planners work closely with a number of community stakeholders, such as government officials and other interested organizations and individuals. [[4]] __Next,__ representatives from the local public health department might provide input in designing a network of trails and sidewalks to encourage people to walk more. Members of the Chamber of Commerce might share suggestions about designing transportation and parking facilities to support local businesses.\n\n[[5]] __People who pursue careers in transportation planning__ have a wide variety of educational backgrounds. A two-year degree in transportation technology may be sufficient for some entry-level jobs in the field. Most jobs, however, require at least a bachelor’s degree; majors of transportation planners are varied, including fields such as urban studies, civil engineering, geography, or transportation and logistics management. For many positions in the field, a master’s degree is required.\n\nTransportation planners perform critical work within the\nbroader field of urban and regional planning. As of 2010, there were approximately 40,300 urban and regional planners employed in the United States.

Heart rate variability (HRV), the increase and decrease in heart rate, occurred simultaneously with subjects’ slowed breathing while singing. This combination of fluctuating heart rate and slowed breathing [[3]] __are__ called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and it has been proven to reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular [[4]] __disease a prior finding independent of the 2013 study.__ One interesting finding from this study is that the subjects’ heartbeats synchronized while they sang together. This may be a factor in choir singers’ reported feelings of happiness and bonding.\n \n[[5]] __People feel a keen sense of bonding when they sing together.__ Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases [[6]] __endorphins. Endorphins blunt__ pain and engender feelings of pleasure. Cortisol, a hormonal reaction to stress and the secretion of which the brain controls, decreases after choir singing. Meanwhile, oxytocin, which the brain interprets as a feeling of emotional bonding, is increased. In a study at Oxford Brookes University, researchers surveyed 375 people who either sang alone, sang in a choir, or participated in organized sports. Those who sang in choir reported the highest levels of happiness. [[7]] __Due to__ its positive side effects, therapists have used choir singing as [[8]] __an element__ for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. A study from an arts and health research center in Canterbury, England, followed the progress of patients diagnosed with depression for a year after they joined a choir. Sixty percent of patients reported improved mental health at the end of that year, and some were no longer [[9]] __experiencing suffering from clinical depression.__\n \n[[10]] From the changes in heartbeat and breathing that result in a healthier heart, to the reduction of cortisol and production of endorphins that lower stress and increase [[11]] __happiness.
