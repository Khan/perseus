The display will feature five animals available for adoption, each in its own pen. The pens will be arranged one next to another in a single row. The organization has eight animals available to bring to the event: four kittens—Fluffy, Garnet, Honey, and Jaguar—and four puppies—Raisin, Scamp, Taffy, and Wags. The display is subject to the following rules:\n\nThe first and fifth pens must hold kittens.\n\nTaffy cannot be displayed next to any kitten.\n\nEither Garnet or Honey, but not both, must be included in the display.\n\nIf Wags is included in the display, Garnet must be in the second pen.","hidePrompt":"Hide prompt","showPrompt":"Show prompt","static":false,"widgets":{}},"static":false,"type":"explanation","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"explanation 2":{"alignment":"default","graded":true,"options":{"explanation":"###What the setup tells us\n\nOut of a total of 8 animals, 5 of them will be displayed for adoption. That’s a strong indicator that we’ll be using an In/Out setup for this **grouping task**. The display case is also in a certain **order** (which you can confirm by peeking at the first rule), which makes this a **mixed setup**. We often create a diagram with two rows (one for the names and one for the types) in a grouping/ordering setup, but since they do tell us which animals are kittens and which are puppies, it can streamline your diagram to use subscripts **k** and **p** instead:\n\n[[☃ image 9]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** The first and fifth pens must hold ***kittens***. We can note this directly in our diagram.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Taffy (p)** cannot be displayed next to any ***kitten***. You may notice some deductions we could already make, but we’ll keep all of our deductions in the next section for organization purposes.\n\n* **Rule 3:** Either **Garnet (k)** or **Honey (k)**, but not both, must be included in the display. We’ll note this to the side.\n\n* **Rule 4:** If **Wags (p)** is included in the display, **Garnet (k)** must be in the 2nd pen. This is conditional logic, so we’ll want to make sure to include the unstated but equivalent rule here as well: If **Garnet (k)** is *not* in the 2nd pen (i.e. in a different pen or Out), then **Wags (p)** must be Out:\n\n[[☃ image 10]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nLet’s look closely at the rules and combine some of them to determine what else must be true that the test isn’t explicitly telling us!\n\n* **Rule 3** tells us that we can’t have *both* **Garnet (k)** and **Honey (k)** in the display—so that means that one of them has to be Out. We can mark that into our diagram, and now one of the three Out spots is taken.\n* Since **Rule 1** tells us that the 1st and 5th pens are ***kittens***, and **Rule 2** tells us that **Taffy (p)** *can’t* be next to a ***kitten***, then we can deduce that **Taffy (p)** *can’t* be in pens 2 or 4. \n* Since **Taffy (p)** is a ***puppy***, that leaves only two places for **Taffy (p)** to go: pen 3 or Out!\n* Because we’ve restricted **Taffy (p)** to one of only two spots, this is a great place for us to build Multiple Scenarios in order to make many more deductions than we could if we only used one diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 11]]\n\nFrom here, we can now make further deductions within each individual scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1:** **Taffy (p)** is in pen 3.\n\n* In this case, there must be ***puppies*** in pens 2 and 4, since **Taffy (p)** can’t be next to any ***kittens*** (Rule 2). \n* That triggers **Rule 4**’s equivalent: since **Garnet (k)** can’t be in pen 2, then **Wags (p)** must be Out (because if **Wags (p)** were in, then **Garnet (k)** would have to be in pen 2—but **Garnet** is a ***kitten***). \n* With three ***puppies*** in and **Wags**—the last ***puppy***—out, that leaves **Raisin (p)** and **Scamp (p)** to be the remaining puppies displayed, though we don’t know the order.\n* So, the remaining “Out” animal must be a ***kitten***, since the ***puppies*** are all placed:\n\n[[☃ image 16]]\n\n**Scenario 2:** **Taffy (p)** is Out.\n\n* There aren’t any obvious deductions here, and that’s common when building Scenarios. \n* However, one thing we *can* notice is that we have a deduction for when **Wags (p)** is in (Rule 4), *and* if **Wags (p)** is out, then our whole Out column would be basically full. That could be really helpful!\n* So, while it’s not required in order to do well on this setup, it won’t take long for us to break this Scenario out into two *further* Scenarios (**Wags (p)** in vs. **Wags (p)** out), for a total of three. Doing so will almost surely save us a lot of time on the questions:\n\n[[☃ image 17]]\n\n**Scenario 2:** **Taffy (p)** is Out *and* **Wags (p)** is in. \n\n* In this case, **Garnet (k)** would be in pen 2 (Rule 4), which leaves pen 3 or 4 for **Wags (p)**.\n* That means that **Honey (k)** is Out (Rule 3).\n* With **Garnet (k)** in pen 2, that means there are three ***kittens*** on display, and **Honey (k)** (the last ***kitten***) is out, so\n* The animals in pens 3 and 4 must be ***puppies***, as well as the final animal to not be displayed:\n\n[[☃ image 18]]\n\n**Scenario 3:** **Taffy (p)** is Out and **Wags (p)** is Out.\n\n* Now that our Out column is basically full, we can deduce that the animals who are In are: **Jaguar (k)**, **Fluffy (k)**, **G/H (k)**, **Raisin (p)**, and **Scamp (p)**:\n\n[[☃ image 19]]\n\nBuilding Multiple Scenarios always takes longer than building just one diagram. But the benefit is that we can understand a lot more about what must be true/false by knowing that *any* acceptable situation will fall into one of these three Scenarios. Here’s the final diagram, which we can use to attack the questions most efficiently:\n\n[[☃ image 20]]","hidePrompt":"Hide explanation","showPrompt":"Show initial setup and deductions","static":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"options":{"alt":"","backgroundImage":{"height":0,"url":null,"width":0},"box":[400,400],"caption":"","labels":[],"range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"title":""},"type":"image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 10":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A mixed diagram and a list of rules.\n\nA mixed diagram consists of five horizontal bars numbered 1 through 5 from left to right.

One artifact per case means that we don’t have any messy situations in which we don’t use an artifact, or in which several artifacts share a case. However, we *are* told that 1) the cases are in a circle, and 2) case 7 is next to case 1. There really isn’t a compelling reason to make a circular diagram, especially if it’ll take longer to do so or be messy on your scratch work. So, one way that we could keep this close to a diagram we’re used to seeing is like this:\n\n[[☃ image 21]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** Either the **Helmet** or the **Javelin** is in case 7. We can note this directly into our diagram.\n\n* **Rule 2:** The **Necklace** is in a lower-numbered case than the **Mask**. We can show this with a note such as **N...M** or **N - M**.\n\n* ** Rule 3:** The **Helmet** is next to the **Mask**. Notice that we’re not told in which *order*, so we can’t make assumptions. As stated, it can be either **HM** or **MH**.\n\n* **Rule 4:** The **Pot** is not next to the **Scythe**. There are many ways to indicate this; we like a rectangle with a slash through it. \n\n* **Rule 5:** Neither the **Pot** nor the **Scythe** is next to the **Javelin**. Here, we have several more elements that can’t be paired:\n\n[[☃ image 22]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* First, we can look for Repeats; **Mask** is in both Rules 2 and 3 so we can combine Rules 2 and 3 to create longer chains: **N...MH** or **N...HM**. \n* These Groups allow us to determine where some of these elements *can’t* go.\n* Since the **Necklace** has to have at least the **Helmet** and **Mask** after it, we can deduce that the **Necklace** can’t be 6th.\n* Likewise, since the **Mask** has at least the **Necklace** before it, the **Mask** can’t be in the 1st case.\n* Finally, since the **Helmet** also has at least the **Necklace** before it, the **Helmet** also can’t be 1st:\n\n[[☃ image 23]]\n\n* Another Group that might not be as obvious is the Group that results from combining Rules 4 and 5: pairs that can *never* happen are **PS**, **PJ**, and **JS**, in some order. So we can simplify all of our “never” rectangles and simply note that no two of **PSJ** can ever be next to each other!\n* Because the **Helmet** is also mentioned in Rule 1, we have a good opportunity to build Scenarios, one in which the **Helmet** is 7th and one in which the **Javelin** is 7th. We should be able to draw additional deductions within each Scenario once we build them:\n\n[[☃ image 24]]\n\n**Scenario 1:** The **Helmet** is 7th.\n\n* In this case, the **Mask** must be next to the **Helmet** (Rule 3). We already determined that the **Mask** can’t be 1st, so the **Mask** must be 6th.\n* The rest of our rules deal with artifacts that *can’t* be next to each other, so we can think about the remaining real estate. \n* We have three artifacts (the **Pot**, **Necklace**, and **Javeline**), *all* of which can’t be adjacent to each other (Rules 4 and 5), and five consecutive cases remaining.\n* That means that these three artifacts must be split up in cases 1, 3, and 5.\n* That leaves the **Necklace** and the **Goblet** to occupy cases 2 and 4:\n\n[[☃ image 25]]\n\n**Scenario 2:** The **Javelin** is 7th.\n\n* In this case, the **Necklace** can’t be 5th, since there needs to be room for at least the **Mask** and the **Helmet** to occupy higher-numbered cases than the **Necklace**’s case (Rules 1 and 2).\n* Since the **Javelin** can’t be next to the **Pot** and the **Scythe** (Rule 5), neither the **Pot** nor the **Scythe** can be in either cases 1 or 6.\n* By process of elimination, that means that the **Mask**, **Goblet**, and **Helmet** are the only artifacts that can go into case 6, and\n* The **Necklace** and **Goblet** are the only artifacts that can go into case 1.\n* Since we already placed the **Javelin** 7th, we can’t make the same deduction that we did in Scenario 1 when we split up the **PSJ** group. We’ll just have to keep an eye on **PS** and make sure they’re never adjacent when we’re working in Scenario 2:\n\n[[☃ image 26]]\n\nAgain, we should see dividends in the questions from having taken the time to 1) build appropriate Scenarios, and 2) think critically about the real estate implications of the **PSJ** trio.

We’re given a preliminary rule in the introduction, which is that each person uses exactly three kinds of flowers in their arrangement, so it’s important to note that. That also tells us that in each person’s arrangement, there will be one kind of flower that’s used twice (but not more than twice, or else the numbers won’t work). Your basic diagram might look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 21]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** ***Solomon*** and no one else uses two **Roses**. We can note two **Roses** next to ***Solomon***. We also deduced in the introduction that ***Solomon*** can’t use a *third* **Rose**, so it could be worth marking that under ***Solomon’s*** remaining spaces so that we don’t forget. Finally, we can note separately that only ***Solomon*** can use two **Roses**.\n\n* **Rule 2:** ***Tabitha*** uses exactly one **Hyacinth** and at least one **Gardenia**. We can note the **Hyacinth** and **Gardenia** in the diagram. So that we don’t forget that ***Tabitha*** can’t use *another* **Hyacinth**, we can mark that fact under the remaining spaces next to ***Tabitha***.\n\n* **Rule 3:** ***Ursula*** uses exactly one **Rose** and at least one **Hyacinth**. We’ll mark this similarly to how we noted Rule 2.\n\n* **Rule 4:** ***Will*** uses two **Gardenias**. Again, this can go into the diagram, and we know that ***Will*** can’t use anymore **Gardenias**. \n\n* **Rule 5:** ***Zepi*** and no one else uses exactly one **Hyacinth** and exactly one **Rose**. We’ll put this directly into the diagram and then also note separately that only ***Zepi*** can have exactly one **Hyacinth** and exactly one **Rose**.\n\n* *Rule 6:** Exactly one person uses two **Lilies**. We don’t know who this is, but it’ll be useful to add it to our running list of separate notes:\n\n[[☃ image 22]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nThere’s a lot going on in this challenging setup! It’ll be more important than ever to stay organized and make sure we aren’t trying to keep anything just in our heads. Let’s analyze what else we know from combining the rules.\n\n* ***Ursula*** must have another **Hyacinth** in the arrangement, since only ***Zepi*** can have exactly one **Hyacinth** and exactly one **Rose** (Rule 5). \n* Since ***Ursula*** can’t have a second **Rose** (Rule 1), the last flower in her arrangement is either a **Gardenia** or **Lily**.\n* ***Zepi*** can’t have anymore **Hyacinths** or **Roses** (Rule 5), so the remaining two flowers in ***Zepi’s*** arrangement must be either two **Gardenias** or two **Lilies** (remember: each arrangement has only 3 kinds of flowers in it). \n* Rule 6 tells us that only one person uses two **Lilies**, so if we analyze our diagram so far, we can deduce that that person could be either ***Tabitha*** or ***Zepi***. Let’s note that:\n\n[[☃ image 23]]\n\nWe *could* make Scenarios around who uses the two **Lilies**, but we have so much information filled out already that we can move to the questions from here.","hidePrompt":"Hide explanation","showPrompt":"Show initial setup and deductions","static":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"options":{"alt":"","backgroundImage":{"height":0,"url":null,"width":0},"box":[400,400],"caption":"","labels":[],"range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"title":""},"type":"image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 10":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A mixed diagram and a list of rules.\n\nA mixed diagram consists of five horizontal bars numbered 1 through 5 from left to right.

We’re also **ordering** in the sense that it matters whether the meeting is in the morning or the afternoon. You could also think of it as ordering/ordering as well; in either case, we’re looking at a **mixed setup**. One important piece to note is that the numbers don’t align perfectly in this task. There are five meetings for six slots; so, it’ll almost surely be important to pay attention to that empty slot and what role it might play. Here’s one example of what a basic diagram could look like:\n\n[[☃ image 21]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** **Hosnani** and **Lemmon** must be scheduled for morning meetings. We can note that directly into the diagram next to the entire “morning” row.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Juarez** must be scheduled for the day before **Garvey**. Note this separately however it makes sense to you; just make sure that the way you do makes it clear that they don’t both have to be morning or afternoon; they just have to be on consecutive days.\n\n* **Rule 3:** At most one other client can be scheduled between the meetings with **Garvey** and **Kallin**. Again, there are many ways to note this; we like using ellipses or a dash, with a note to remind ourselves that there is a maximum of one client between the two. Also, be careful not to assume the order of **Garvey** and **Kallin**: we don’t know which one is earlier:\n\n[[☃ image 22]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nThere are only three rules to work with, and the rules don’t provide us many concrete details. Let’s see what we can glean from what little we have.\n\n* One Group is the **JG** pair. From Rule 2 we can deduce that **Juarez** can never be on Friday, and **Garvey** can never be on Monday—let’s note those deductions directly into the diagram.\n* Since we don’t know the order of **Kallin** and **Garvey**, we can’t make a similar deduction for them.\n* We *can* take a moment to analyze what restrictions we do see:\n* Because **Hosnani** and **Lemmon** are both in the morning, the morning row is very restricted. If a question asked us to place someone (not including these two) in the morning, we would then be able to place an **H/L** in the remaining two spaces.\n* The empty meeting spot should prove to be important as well. For example, under what condition could the empty meeting spot be on Thursday?\n* The only way the empty meeting spot could be on Thursday is if the other Thursday slot were **Juarez** or **Garvey**! Otherwise, there would be no way for **Juarez** and **Garvey** to be consecutive.\n* For that matter, either **Juarez** or **Garvey** *must* be on Thursday at some point; otherwise, there would be no way for them to be consecutive! We can note that in the diagram as well.\n* These are the kinds of deductions you should take the time to make; although they don’t allow us to determine the exact placement of an element, they allow us to understand the setup better before heading into the questions.\n* Here is a final diagram that we can use to attack the questions with:\n\n[[☃ image 23]]","hidePrompt":"Hide explanation","showPrompt":"Show initial setup and deductions","static":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"options":{"alt":"","backgroundImage":{"height":0,"url":null,"width":0},"box":[400,400],"caption":"","labels":[],"range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"title":""},"type":"image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 10":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A mixed diagram and a list of rules.\n\nA mixed diagram consists of five horizontal bars numbered 1 through 5 from left to right.
