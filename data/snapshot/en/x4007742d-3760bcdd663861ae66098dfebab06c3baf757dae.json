[{"content":"## Introduction\n\nIn this article, we'll practice the art of translating shapes. Mathematically speaking, we will learn how to draw the image of a given shape under a given translation.\n\nA translation by $\\langle a,b \\rangle$ is a transformation that moves *all* points $a$ units in the $x$-direction and $b$ units in the $y$-direction.
