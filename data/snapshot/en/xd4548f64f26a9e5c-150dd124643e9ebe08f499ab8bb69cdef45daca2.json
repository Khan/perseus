[{"content":"## Lesson summary\n\nInvestment spending is an important category of real GDP. Not only is it usually the most volatile part of real GDP, but investment spending on physical capital is also an important contributor to economic growth. So, if a firm wants to build a new factory, where does it get the funds to build it? Usually, firms borrow that money. \n\nThe **market for loanable funds** describes how that borrowing happens. The supply of loanable funds is based on savings. The demand for loanable funds is based on borrowing. The interaction between the supply of savings and the demand for loans determines the real interest rate and how much is loaned out.","images":{},"widgets":{}},{"content":"##Key Terms\n\nKey term | Definition \n-|- \n**the market for loanable funds** | a hypothetical market that shows how loans from savers are allocated to borrowers who have investment projects\n**savings-investment spending identity** | an equation that demonstrates that investment spending and savings are always equal to each other; if there is $\\$100{,}000$ in investment in an economy, that $\\$100{,}000$ has to come out of savings.\n**budget surplus** | when taxes collected are more than the amount of government spending, the difference between taxes and government spending is a budget surplus\n**budget deficit** | when taxes collected are less than the amount of government spending, the difference between taxes and government spending is a budget deficit\n**budget balance** | when the amount of taxes collected is exactly equal to the amount of government spending\n**public saving** | the difference between taxes collected and government spending; when there is a budget surplus public saving is positive, but when there is a budget deficit public saving is negative.\n**disposable income** | income that is left for consumption after taxes are paid; if your income is $\\$100$ and you pay $\\$5$ in taxes, your disposable income is $\\$95$.\n**private saving** | what is left of disposable income after consumption is taken out; if your disposable income is $\\$95$ and you spend $\\$70$, you have $\\$25$ left in savings.\n**national savings** | the total amount of private saving and public saving\n**closed economy** | an economy which does not allow international trade or the movement of financial assets into or out of a country\n**open economy** | an economy which does allow international trade or the movement of financial assets into or out of a country\n**foreign funds** | financial assets, such as money, that come into a country from another country; if a resident of Florin buys a bond from the government of Guilder, that purchase represents foreign funds coming *into* Guilder.\n**domestic outflow of funds** | financial assets that leave a country; If a resident of Florin buys a bond from the government of Guilder, that purchase represents domestic funds flowing *out of* Florin.\n**capital inflows** | financial capital coming into a country; capital inflows are equal to the inflow of foreign funds minus the outflow of domestic funds.\n**rate of return** | percentage gain or loss on an investment or the increase or decrease in value over time; for example, if a project costs $\\$100$ to do but will generate $\\$108$ in sales, its rate of return is 8%.\n**demand for loanable funds** | a hypothetical curve that shows the willingness to borrow money to fund investment projects; as the interest rate decreases, the quantity of loans demanded will increase.\n**supply of loanable funds** | a hypothetical curve that shows the willingness to save money and put it into a financial intermediary.\n","images":{},"widgets":{}},{"content":"##Key Takeaways\n\n### National savings\n\nIn a closed economy, national savings is the sum of private saving and the public saving. In an open economy, national saving is the sum of private savings, the public saving, and net capital inflows. \n\nFor example, suppose the nation of Florin has:\n\n- a national income of $\\$100$ million, \n- taxes of $\\$10$ million, \n- consumption spending of $\\$60$ million\n\n- government spending of $\\$8$ million, \n\n- and net capital inflows of $\\$4$ million. \n\nThe national savings that they have available is therefore:\n\n$\\begin{align}\\text{National savings}&=Private savings + Public savings + NCI\\\\\\\\\n&=(\\$100 \\text{ million income}  - \\$10 \\text{ million taxes} - \\$60 \\text{ million consumption}) + (\\$10 \\text{ million taxes} - \\$8 \\text{ million government spending}) + \\$4 \\text{ million NCI}\\\\\\\\\n&=\\$30 \\text{ million} + \\$2 \\text{ million}  + \\$4 \\text{ million} \\\\\\\\\n&=\\$36 \\text{ million} \\end{align}$\n\nNational savings would be $\\$36$ million in Florin. That means there is $\\$36$ million in savings that could be turned into loans that could fund investment spending.\n\n\n### The loanable funds market describes the behavior of savers and borrowers. \n\nThe market for loanable funds is a way of representing all of the potential savers and all of the potential borrowers in an economy. It has the same features of other markets that we have seen before, but with a few twists:\n\n- Quantity - loans are being “bought” and “sold” in this market. The “quantity” in this market is really the quantity of loans or, more formally, the quantity of loanable funds. Why? It’s not how many loans are being made, but how much loaning is going on.\n- Price - the cost of borrowing is the real interest rate, and the reward for savings is the real interest rate. Therefore, we use the real interest rate (rather than price) in the market for loanable funds.\n- Supply - The supply of loanable funds represents the behavior of all of the savers in an economy. The higher interest rate that a saver can earn, the more likely they are to save money. As such, the supply of loanable funds shows that the quantity of savings available will increase as the interest rate increases.\n- Demand - The demand for loanable funds represents the behavior of borrowers and the quantity of loans demanded. The lower the interest rate, the less expensive it is to borrow. \n- Equilibrium - The equilibrium in the market for loanable funds is achieved when the quantities of loans that borrowers want are the same as the quantity of savings that savers provide. The interest rate adjusts to make these equal.\n[[☃ explanation 1]]\n\n###Changes in the demand for loanable funds\n\nAnything that changes investment demand will change the demand for loanable funds. Examples of events that can shift the demand for loanable funds are\n\n- Changes in the anticipated rate of return earned on investment spending\n- Government policies\n\nThere is an important implication of that first determinant of investment demand: real interest rates are procyclical. When the economy is doing well, the rate of return on any investment spending will increase. That means the demand for loanable funds will increase, which leads to a higher real interest rate. In other words, we would expect to see an increase in real interest rates, and the quantity of loans made, when the economy is doing well.\n\nSome government policies, such as investment tax credits, basically lower the cost of borrowing money at every real interest rate. Such policies would increase the demand for loanable funds. Other policies, such as budget deficits, might increase the demand for loanable funds. \n\n###Changes in the supply of loanable funds changes\n\nAnything that impacts savings behavior impacts the supply of loanable funds. Some examples of that are:\n\n- Changes in saving behavior, such as preferences for saving or having more wealth\n- Changes in capital inflows \n- Changes in public savings\n\n### Do deficits cause a shift in supply or demand?\n\nThat’s an interesting question! There are actually two points of view:\n\n- *Deficits increase the demand for loanable funds; surpluses decrease the demand for loanable funds*. The logic of this point of view is that if the government runs a deficit, it has to borrow money just like everyone else. So, if there is a deficit, the demand for loanable funds will increase because the government gets in line to borrow money just like all of the other borrowers.\n\n- *Deficits decrease the supply of loanable funds; surpluses increase the supply of loanable funds*. The logic of this point of view is that national savings includes public savings (T-G), and national savings is the source of the supply of loanable funds. So anything that makes T-G smaller (like a deficit) or bigger (like a surplus) will shift the supply of loanable funds\n\nBut that doesn’t mean both curves shift? Supply and demand do not have the same determinants in any market. Your graphical model should reflect only one point of view.\n\nIn the end, both points of view have the same impact on the real interest rate: deficits increase the real interest rate and surpluses decrease the real interest rate.\n\n### The Fisher Effect\n\nThe Fisher effect states that an increase in expected future inflation will increase nominal interest rates by exactly the amount of expected inflation. Expected inflation will have no impact on either the quantity of loanable funds or the real interest rate.\n\nFor example, suppose the current rate of inflation is 2% and the real interest rate is 5%. Then the current nominal interest rate is 7%:\n\n$\\begin{align}\\text{Nominal interest rate} & = \\text{real interest rate} + \\text{inflation}\\\\\\\\\n&=5\\%+2\\%\\\\\\\\\n&=7\\%\\end{align}$\n\nIf people expect inflation to decrease by 1%, then both savers and borrowers will take this into account, and they will incorporate this into their expected rate of inflation:\n\n$\\begin{align}\\text{Nominal interest rate} & = \\text{real interest rate} + \\text{inflation}\\\\\\\\\n&=5\\%+(-1)\\%\\\\\\\\\n&=4\\%\\end{align}$\f","images":{},"widgets":{"explanation 1":{"type":"explanation","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"showPrompt":"Can you provide a more concrete example?","hidePrompt":"Hide this now, please.","explanation":"Sure! Suppose there are some people in Florin who each have $\\$1000$ that they are considering spending or saving. Each of them has different preferences for consumption and saving, which impacts their willingness to save. For example, Westley is very patient and willing to save money even at low-interest rates. But Humperdink would much rather spend money, so it takes a pretty high-interest rate to convince him to save:\n\nPerson | minimum interest rate needed to save $\\$1000$ | Total savings available at this interest rate\n-|-|-\nWestley | 1% | $\\$1000$\nButtercup | 2% | $\\$2000$\nInigo | 3% | $\\$3000$\nFizzig | 4% | $\\$4000$\nYellin | 5% | $\\$5000$\nBella | 6% | $\\$6000$\nValerie | 7% | $\\$1000$\nHumperdink | 8% | $\\$8000$\n\nAt the same time, a few of the businesses in Florin have some capital projects they would like to complete. The table below summarizes them:\n\nFirm | Capital Project and cost | Projected return \n-|-|-\nMiracle Max’s Magic Academy | new lecturing equipment - $\\$1300$ | 2%\nDread Pirate Roberts’ School of Sailing | new sail $\\$1600$ | 3%\nCount Rugen’s Rack’o’Ribs | new grill $\\$1900$ | 4%\nVizzini Pharma | develop iocaine antidote $\\$2000$ | 5%\nYeste’s Sword o'Rama | new foundry $\\$3000$ | 6% \n\nFor all of these potential borrowers, they would be willing to pay up to their expected return in interest, but not more. We can organize this to represent the amount of funds that people would want to borrow and save at various interest rates:\n\nReal interest rate | QD LF | QS LF \n-|-|-\n1% | $\\$1300$ +$\\$1600$ +$\\$2100$ + $\\$2000$ + $\\$3000$ = $\\$10,000$ | $\\$1000$\n2% | $\\$1300$ + $\\$1600$ + $\\$2100$ + $\\$2000$ + $\\$3000$ =$\\$10,000 $| $\\$2000$ \n3% | $\\$1600$ + $\\$2100$ + $\\$2000$ + $\\$3000$ = $\\$8,700$  | $\\$3000$\n4% | $\\$2100$ + $\\$2000$ + $\\$3000$ = $\\$7100$ | $\\$4000$\n5% | $\\$2000$ + $\\$3000$ = $\\$5,000$ | $\\$5000$\n6% | $\\$3,000$ | $\\$6,000$\n\n\nHow does the interest rate adjust? Suppose the real interest rate is currently 10%. Only Yeste would be willing to borrow money, but everyone would want to supply their savings at this interest rate. There would be surplus savings available to loan out. This surplus will put downward pressure on the interest rate. As the interest rate decreases, fewer people want to save, but more businesses want to borrow. The interest rate continues to adjust until the market for loanable funds clears.\n\nIn this market, the equilibrium would be a real interest rate of 5% and the quantity of loanable funds loaned would be $\\$5,000$:\n\n![](web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/0047ebdc41c555f4113975c95b5a7e53aed74e92)\n\n","widgets":{}},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},{"content":"##Key graphical models\n\n### The market for loanable funds\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nThe market for loanable funds shows the supply of savings and the demand for loans.

Let’s start with the fact that national income (Y) is equal to aggregate expenditures:\n\n$Y=C+I+G+NX$\n\nTo make things simpler, let’s assume that the economy is a closed economy. That means that there is no international trade and there is no movement of financial assets into or out of a country. So, the NX disappears from our national income:\n\n$Y=C+I+G$\n\nNotice the “$I$”? That is investment spending from our savings and investment identity! So, let’s isolate “$I$” so it is on its own in the equation:\n\n$Y-C-G = I$\n\nBefore we can break this down further, we need to recognize that government spending is paid using taxes. Taxes are taken out of income, and then government spending is taken out of taxes, as shown in the equation below:\n\n$\\color{purple}Y-\\color{purple}T-\\color{purple}C + \\color{orange}T-\\color{orange}G = I$\n\nWe are left with two components of national saving: private saving (Y-T-C) and public saving (T-G).\n\nOk, so what if this is an open economy, not a closed economy? In that case, we have to allow for the possibility that some of these savings on the left-hand side of the equation will go overseas, or that some savings will come overseas into this economy. So, we also need to include net capital inflows ($NCI$):\n\n$\\color{purple}Y-\\color{purple}T-\\color{purple}C + \\color{orange}T-\\color{orange}G + \\color{green}{NCI} = I$\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation shows the total amount of savings available.
