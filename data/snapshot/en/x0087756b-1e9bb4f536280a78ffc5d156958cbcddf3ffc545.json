This way we can find the solution for $x$, and then substitute it into the second equation to find the solution for $y$. This is called *the substitution method.*\n\nWe are given that $\\pink y = \\pink{2x-5}$. Let's substitute this expression into the first equation and solve for $x$ as follows:\n\n$\\qquad \\begin{align} 5x-4\\pink{y}&=-10\\\\\\\\\n5x-4\\cdot(\\pink{2x-5})&=-10\\\\\\\\\n5x-8x+20& = -10\\\\\\\\\n-3x&=-30\\\\\\\\\nx&=10\n\\end{align}$\n\nSince we now know that $\\blue x=\\blue{10}$, we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for $y$ as follows:\n\n$\\qquad \\begin{align} y &= 2\\cdot \\blue{x}-5 \\\\\\\\\ny&=2\\cdot\\blue{10}-5\\\\\\\\\ny&=15 \\end{align}$\n\nThis is the solution of the system:\n\n- $x = 10$\n\n- $y=15$"},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"video 12":{"type":"video","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"location":"the-substitution-method"},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}},{"content":"## Problem 13: Solving equations\n\n[[☃ graded-group 13]]\n\n[[☃ explanation 13]]\n\n### Related video\n\n[[☃ video 13]]","images":{},"widgets":{"graded-group 13":{"type":"graded-group","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"content":"**Which expressions are equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$ ?**  \n\n[[☃ radio 1]]","images":{},"widgets":{"radio 1":{"type":"radio","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"choices":[{"content":"$4(n-3) -6n$","correct":true},{"content":"$2(2n-6)$","correct":false},{"isNoneOfTheAbove":true}],"randomize":false,"multipleSelect":true,"displayCount":null,"hasNoneOfTheAbove":true,"onePerLine":true,"deselectEnabled":false},"version":{"major":1,"minor":0}}}},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"explanation 13":{"type":"explanation","alignment":"default","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"showPrompt":"Explain solution","hidePrompt":"Hide explanation","explanation":"We can play around with the expressions in the answer choices to see if they are the same as $-6n+(-12)+4n$.\n\nLet's see if the first expression is equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$.\n\n$\\qquad\n\\begin{align}\n\\\\\\\\\n{4(n-3) -6n}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -6n+(-12)+4n  \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4(n-3) -6n}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n+(-12)   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4(n-3) -6n}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{(4)n-(4)3 -6n}  &\\stackrel{?}{=}-2n-12   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4n-12 -6n}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12    \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{-2n-12}   &= -2n-12 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n \\end{align}$\n\nLet's see if the second expression is equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$.\n\n$\\qquad\n\\begin{align}\n\\\\\\\\\n{2(2n-6)}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -6n+(-12)+4n  \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{2(2n-6)}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n+(-12)   \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{2(2n-6)}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{(2)2n-(2)6}  &\\stackrel{?}{=} -2n-12 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n{4n-12}   &\\ne -2n-12\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\n \\end{align}$\n\nThe following expression is equivalent to $-6n+(-12)+4n$ :\n\n-  ${4(n-3) -6n} $"},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"video 13":{"type":"video","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"location":"equivalent-expressions-with-distribution-and-negative-numbers"},"version":{"major":0,"minor":0}}}}]
