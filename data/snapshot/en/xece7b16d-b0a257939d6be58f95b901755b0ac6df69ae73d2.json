If we use a coordinate grid, we can say something more exact: \"We get $\\maroonD{B'}$ by translating $\\blueD{B}$ by 5 units to the right and 4 units down.\"\n\n\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nMore compactly, we can describe this as **a translation by $\\langle 5,-4 \\rangle$.**\n\nThe negative sign in front of the 4 tells us the vertical shift is downwards instead of upwards. Similarly, a translation to the left is indicated by the first value being negative.\n\n###Pre-images and images\n\nFor any transformation, we have the **pre-image** figure, which is the figure we are performing the transformation upon, and the **image** figure, which is the result of the transformation. For example, in our translation, the pre-image point was $\\blueD{B}$ and the image point was $\\maroonD{B'}$.\n\nNote that we indicated the image by $\\maroonD{B'}$, pronounced B prime. It is common, when working with transformations, to use the same letter for the image and the pre-image, simply adding the \"prime\" suffix to the image.","images":{"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/4cefbcb284fe4e9faa7bb67dc1c55f22534097f9":{"width":255,"height":255},"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/78f0c6ffa4f435bb27d80c75adbee450ed6d7a71":{"width":281,"height":281}},"widgets":{"image 2":{"type":"image","alignment":"block","static":false,"graded":true,"options":{"static":false,"title":"","range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"box":[255,255],"backgroundImage":{"url":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/4cefbcb284fe4e9faa7bb67dc1c55f22534097f9","width":255,"height":255},"labels":[],"alt":"A pre-image point labeled B at the top left of the space.
