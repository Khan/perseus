There aren’t any grouping aspects to this task, so it’s not a mixed setup. A basic ordering diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** The **Sunflowers** must be shipped earlier than the **Orchids**. We can show this relationship using a dash.\n\n* **Rule 2:** The **Orchids** must be shipped earlier than the **Roses**, the **Violets**, and the **Zinnias**. We can again use dashes, but note that we *don’t* know the relationship between **Violets** and **Zinnias**, for example—we only know how three of the flowers relate to **Orchids** specifically.\n\n* **Rule 3:** The **Zinnias** must be shipped earlier than the **Lilies**.\n\n* **Rule 4:** The **Tulips** must be shipped earlier than both the **Lilies** and the **Mums**:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\nNote that some students prefer to combine as they go along; others prefer to keep the rules separate and then combine in a new step. As you practice these types of ordering tasks, feel free to choose the method that’s more comfortable for you.\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nIf you *didn’t* combine as you go through the rules, it’s a good idea to do so now. We’ll combine rules that have an element in common, with the goal of creating a larger chain of elements. It doesn’t matter what order you combine in, but we like to start with the largest chain—in this case, the **O/R/V/Z** chain.\n\n* From there, we can add the **S—O** chain, using **O** as the common element.\n* We can add the **Z—L** chain, using **Z** as the common element.\n* Finally, we can add the **T/L/M** group, using **L** as the common element:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nBefore moving on to the questions, we can ask ourselves a few questions.\n\n*Are all elements accounted for in the primary chain?*  \n\n* Yes; the introductory paragraph mentions eight types of flowers, and all eight are represented in the primary chain.\n* If this *weren’t* the case, we would want to be very careful to keep the missing element(s) in mind, as it/they could go *anywhere* in the order!\n\n*Which flower(s) could be 1st?*  \n\n* **Sunflowers* __*and*__ **Tulips** could be 1st!\n* Be careful not to overlook **Tulips** just because it’s “farther to the right” in the diagram. The dashes show only relative order, but *not* distance. \n* In other words, **Tulips** could be as early as 1st, because no other flower is *stopping* **Tulips** from being 1st. \n* You can think of the dashes as being “stretchy”.\n* So, any flower that *doesn’t* have a flower directly connected to the left of it can be 1st.\n\n*Which flower(s) could be last?*\n\n* There are four: **Roses**, **Violets**, **Lilies**, and **Mums**.\n* Again, this is because none of these four flowers are *prevented* from being last.\n\n***Remember:*** if two elements aren’t connected in a linear fashion in your chain, you *cannot* determine their relationship. Keep this in mind as you work through the questions!\n","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"An ordering diagram and a list of elements.

That tells us that there’s a grouping task here. We’re *also* told that each project is completed “at a different time”, which is a strong indicator of an ordering task. So, we’re working with a **mixed setup**, which we can represent in a basic diagram that might look like this:\n\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** Either **Fredericks** or **Lee** is assigned ***Z***. One way to represent this is with a rectangle that shows this grouping. It’s a good idea to make the rectangle match the orientation of the diagram in order to best discern where groupings can go.\n\n* **Rule 2:** **Fredericks** is assigned ***W*** if **Guerrero** is not. Let’s be careful with this rule. It tells us that *if* **Guerrero** isn’t assigned ***W***, *then* **Fredericks** __is__ assigned ***W***. So, logically, if **Fredericks** *isn’t* assigned ***W***, then **Guerrero** __is__ assigned ***W***. What does that mean? One or the other *must* be assigned ***W***! Think of it as saying, “If I don’t buy groceries tonight, my roommate will.” There’s no way that both my roommate and I skip buying the groceries, because if I *don’t* buy it, they *will*. So if for some reason they don’t, that must mean that I buy them. So, either I or my roommate *will* buy groceries tonight. [In the groceries example, it’s possible that we both buy groceries, but here, it’s not possible for two architects to be assigned to the same project due to the constraints in the introductory paragraph.] This is a great deduction for us to make at this stage, and we can represent the rule with a rectangle similar to Rule 1’s rectangle.\n\n* **Rule 3:** **Horowitz** is assigned ***Y*** if **Fredericks** is not assigned ***W***. Again, let’s rephrase this in an “if X then Y” structure, since students tend to have the easiest time with conditional logic that takes that form:  If **Fredericks** is not assigned ***W***, then **Horowitz** is assigned ***Y***. The contrapositive of this is that if **Horowitz** *isn’t* assigned to ***Y***, then **Fredericks** *is* assigned ***W***. From this, we can deduce—similar to what we deduced in Rule 2—that at least one or the other *must* happen; either **Horowitz** is assigned ***Y*** or **Fredericks** is assigned ***W*** or both. \n\n* **Rule 4:** **Fredericks**'s project is completed immediately before **Guerrero**'s. There are many ways to note this; we’ll use a horizontal rectangle.\n\n* **Rule 5:** **Horowitz**'s project is completed last. We can build this directly into the diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\nIt was important to take our time, particularly with the complex conditional logic rules. The time taken allowed us to get a head start on some of the deductions, and that’ll pay off when we get to the questions!\n\n###What else can we deduce?\n\nRule 4 might jump out at you as being particularly interesting, given that we already placed **Horowitz** 4th, and there are only 4 spots. We have a great opportunity to build Multiple Scenarios, since only two things can happen around Rule 4—the **FG** pair can only fit two different ways into the diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nLet’s analyze each scenario one at a time to determine what deductions we can make.\n\n**Scenario 1:** **FG** is 1st/2nd.\n\n* In this case, only **Lee** is left to occupy the 3rd spot. \n* Since either **Fredericks** or **Guerrero** is assigned to ***W*** (Rule 2), ***W*** can’t be 3rd or 4th.\n* And, since either **Fredericks** or **Lee** is assigned to ***Z*** (Rule 1), ***Z*** can’t be 2nd or 4th.\n* That means that the 4th spot has to be either ***X*** or ***Y*** (since we just determined that it can’t be ***W*** or ***Z***):\n\n[[☃ image 4]]\n\n**Scenario 2:** **FG** is 2nd/3rd.\n\n* We can make similar deductions here! \n* Again, either ***X*** or ***Y*** is 4th, since ***W*** and ***Z*** both go with architects who *aren’t* **Horowitz**.\n* ***W*** can’t be 1st or 4th (Rule 2), and\n* ***Z*** can’t be 3rd or 4th (Rule 1):\n\n\n[[☃ image 5]]\n\nWe no longer need the **FG** rule, since it’s built directly into our Scenarios. We can head to the questions armed with this main diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 6]]\n\nSince we took the time to build the Multiple Scenarios, the questions should be faster and easier to solve! If you’re new to Scenarios, you may want to try this setup again *without* using them, so that you can compare and get a feel for how they can improve your performance on Test Day.","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A mixed diagram contains two horizontal rows of four spots each, numbered 1 through 4. the top row is labeled F G H L.

We’re given more information about each office, which is that one person is nominated for ***mayor***, one for ***treasurer***, and two for ***councillor***. There’s no ordering task to work with, so this is a classic **grouping setup**. It can be helpful to create an Out column also; if we know who’s out, then we know who’s in. Your main diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** If **Frost** is one of the nominees, **Grant** cannot be one of the nominees. This is a conditional logic rule, and it also indicates that if **Grant** is one of the nominees, then **Frost** is *not* one of the nominees (in other words, out).\n\n* **Rule 2:** If **Hu** is a nominee for ***councillor***, **Jensen** must be the nominee for ***mayor***. This is another conditional logic rule, and it’s a good idea to note the logical equivalent: if **Jensen** *isn’t* the nominee for ***mayor***, then **Hu** *isn’t* a nominee for ***councillor***. \n\n* **Rule 3:** The nominee for ***treasurer*** must be either **Frost** or **Hu**. We can build this directly into our diagram.\n\n* **Rule 4:** **Kuno** cannot be a nominee for ***councillor***. We can also build this directly into the diagram:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* From Rule 1, we can deduce that **Frost** and **Grant** *can’t* both be nominated. \n* That means that we can reserve an “Out” spot for either **Frost** or **Grant**.\n* Be careful here! They *could* both be out; they just can’t both be in (nominated).\n\nThere isn’t much more that we can deduce. You could build Multiple Scenarios around **Hu* being ***councillor***, not ***councillor***, and *out*, but it isn’t necessary in this setup.

Since we’ll have eight spots and only six companies, that means that *two* of the companies will offer both. There’s no ordering task to work with, so this is a **grouping setup**. A basic diagram could start out like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** **HCN** cannot offer any type of bond that **Lorilou** does. We can show this using a rectangle with a line through it.\n\n* **Rule 2:** If **VELSOR** offers ***5-year*** bonds, then **SamsonGonzales** must offer both types of bonds. This is a conditional logic rule, which means it’s usually a good idea to write down the logical equivalent as well: if **SamsonGonzales** *doesn’t* offer both bonds (in other words, doesn’t offer ***5-year*** or ***10-year*** bonds), then **VELSOR** *doesn’t* offer ***5-year*** bonds (in other words **VELSOR** would have to offer ***10-year*** bonds). \n\n* **Rule 3:** If **Lorilou** offers ***10-year*** bonds, then **RST** must also do so. This is another conditional logic rule. The logically equivalent rule would be: if **RST** *doesn’t* offer ***10-year*** bonds (in other words, offers ***5-year*** only), then **Lorilou** *doesn’t* offer ***10-year*** bonds (and must offer only ***5-year*** bonds):\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* In many setups, the numbers line up well (6 horses and 6 spots, for example). That’s not the case in this setup, so it’s a good idea to pay attention to the numbers.\n* Since *two* companies offer both types of bonds, that means that in each row, two of the companies listed will offer *only* that type of bond, and the other two companies listed will be the companies that offer both. This may sound obvious, but it’s worth paying attention to.\n* Additionally, we can rule out **HCN** and **Lorilou** as the companies that offer both bonds, since neither of them can offer the same kind as the other. Let’s note an **=1** next to each of their initials in our list of elements.\n* Moreover, we can actually reserve a spot in each group for **H/L**, given that one has to offer only one type of bond and the other company has to offer only the other type of bond.\n* That leaves one more single-bond company in each group and two both-bond companies:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\nThat’s about all we can do for now, but we should find that taking a moment to analyze the numbers breakdown should prove very helpful in the questions!","images":{},"replace":false,"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A grouping diagram and a list of elements.
