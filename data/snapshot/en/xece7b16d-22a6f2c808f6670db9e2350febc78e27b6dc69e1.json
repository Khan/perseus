Similarly, a translation to the left is indicated by the first value being negative.\n\n###Pre-images and images\n\nFor any transformation, we have the **pre-image** figure, which is the figure we are performing the transformation upon, and the **image** figure, which is the result of the transformation. For example, in our translation, the pre-image point was $\\blueD{B}$ and the image point was $\\maroonD{B'}$.\n\nNote that we indicated the image by $\\maroonD{B'}$, pronounced B prime. It is common, when working with transformations, to use the same letter for the image and the pre-image, simply adding the \"prime\" suffix to the image.","images":{},"widgets":{"image 1":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"Point B is translated five units to the right and four units down to form B prime.","backgroundImage":{"height":281,"url":"web+graphie://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/78f0c6ffa4f435bb27d80c75adbee450ed6d7a71","width":281},"box":[281,281],"caption":"","labels":[],"range":[[0,10],[0,10]],"static":false,"title":""},"static":false,"type":"image","version":{"major":0,"minor":0}},"image 2":{"alignment":"block","graded":true,"options":{"alt":"A pre-image point labeled B at the top left of the space.
