Both sine and cosine can be used to model periodic contexts. We can decide which is better fitting by considering the $y$-intercept. The sine function intercepts the $y$-axis at its *midline*, and the cosine function intercepts the $y$-axis at its *peak*.\n\nThat way, since the water is at its peak at time $u = 0$, let's use a cosine function to model its distance, since cosine functions also reach a peak at $u = 0$.\n\nThe depth of the water has period $3$ seconds. Its midline is halfway between its maximum of $55 \\text{ cm}$ and its minimum of $12\\text{ cm}$, or\n\n$\\dfrac{55 + 12}{2} = 33.5$\n\nIts amplitude is half the difference between its maximum of $55 \\text{ cm}$ and its minimum of $12 \\text{ cm}$, or\n\n$\\dfrac{55 - 12}{2} = 21.5$\n","images":{},"widgets":{}},{"content":"Since the ordinary cosine function $f(u) = \\cos u$ has period $2\\pi$, midline $y = 0$, and amplitude $1$, we can stretch it horizontally by a factor of $\\red{\\dfrac{3}{2\\pi}}$ , stretch it vertically by a factor of $\\blue{21.5}$, and move it up $\\green{33.5}$ units:\n\n$\\qquad D(u) = \\blue{21.5}\\cos\\left(\\red{\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}}u\\right) + \\green{33.5}$","images":{},"widgets":{}},{"content":"Since the water reaches its peak $1.1$ seconds after the stopwatch is started, $t$ seconds after the stopwatch is started is $t - 1.1$ seconds after that peak, so $u = t - 1.1$:\n\n$\\qquad D(t) = \\blue{21.5}\\cos\\left(\\red{\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}}(t-1.1)\\right) + \\green{33.5}$","images":{},"widgets":{}},{"content":"The function\n\n$\\qquad D(t) = \\blue{21.5}\\cos\\left(\\red{\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}}(t-1.1)\\right) + \\green{33.5}$\n\nhas period $3$, amplitude $21.5$ and midline $y = 33.5$, and it reaches its peak at time $t = 1.1$, so it's a good model of the depth of the water.\n\n![](https://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/1bebafccb5029c44f748c7d568856071a5a7b553.png)","images":{"https://ka-perseus-graphie.s3.amazonaws.com/1bebafccb5029c44f748c7d568856071a5a7b553.png":{"height":462,"width":462}},"widgets":{}}],"itemDataVersion":{"major":0,"minor":1},"question":{"content":"Wei is standing in wavy water and notices the depth of the waves varies in a periodic way that can be modeled by a trigonometric function.
