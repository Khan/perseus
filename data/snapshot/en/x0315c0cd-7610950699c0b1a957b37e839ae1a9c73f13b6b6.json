[{"content":"## What is the linear standard form?\n\nThis is the standard form of linear equations in two variables:\n\n$\\blueD ax+\\greenD by=\\goldD c$\n\nUsually in this form, $\\blueD a$, $\\greenD b$, and $\\goldD c$ are all integers.\n\n*Want to learn more about standard form?

This also allows us to graph it.\n\nConsider, for example, the equation $\\blueD2x+\\greenD3y=\\goldD{12}$. If we set $x=0$, we get the equation $\\greenD3y=\\goldD{12}$, and we can quickly tell that $y=4$, which means the $y$-intercept is $(0,4)$.\n\nIn a similar way, we can set $y=0$ to get $\\blueD2x=\\goldD{12}$ and find that the $x$-intercept is $(6,0)$. Now we can graph the line:\n\n\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n[[☃ graded-group-set 1]]\n\n*Want to try more problems like this?
