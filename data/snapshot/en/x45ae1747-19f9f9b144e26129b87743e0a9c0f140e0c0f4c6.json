[{"content":"## What are the foci of an ellipse?\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nThe $\\maroonC{\\text{foci}}$ of an ellipse are two points whose sum of distances from any point on the ellipse is always the same. They lie on the ellipse's $\\greenD{\\text{major radius}}$.\n\nThe distance between each focus and the center is called the **focal length** of the ellipse. The following equation relates the focal length $f$ with the major radius $p$ and the minor radius $q$:\n\n$f^2=p^2-q^2$\n\n*Want to learn more about the foci of an ellipse?

Then, the foci will lie on the major axis, $f$ units away from the center (in each direction). Let's find, for example, the foci of this ellipse:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\nWe can see that the major radius of our ellipse is $5$ units, and its minor radius is $4$ units.\n\n$\\begin{align}\nf^2\u0026=p^2-q^2\n\\\\\\\\\nf^2\u0026=5^2-4^2\n\\\\\\\\\nf^2\u0026=9\n\\\\\\\\\nf\u0026=3\n\\end{align}$\n\nThe major axis is the horizontal one, so the foci lie $\\greenD3$ units to the right and left of the center.
