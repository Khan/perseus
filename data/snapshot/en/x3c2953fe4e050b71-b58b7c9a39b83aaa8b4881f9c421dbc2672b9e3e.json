There’s no grouping task, so this is a classic **ordering** setup. A basic diagram could look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** At least two weeks must separate the sale on **Headphones** and the sale on **Speakers**. Note that we *don’t* know which of the two products is earlier! So we could note this rule like this:  \n  \n**H/S __ __ ... S/H** \n  \n* **Rule 2:** **Printers** and **Speakers** must be on sale during consecutive weeks. Again, we don’t know the exact order here—only that the two products are adjacent: **PS** or **SP**  \n\n* **Rule 3:** **Televisions** must be on sale during either the 1st or the 7th week. Let’s use an arrow to note this directly in our diagram, and make a mental note that **Televisions** is pretty restricted in where it can go.\n\n* **Rule 4:** If **Televisions** are not on sale during the 1st week, **Refrigerators** must be on sale then. This is technically a conditional logic rule, but it really just means that either **Televisions** or **Refrigerators** must be 1st; no other products can be on sale in the 1st week. We can build that directly into our diagram instead of writing out the conditional logic notation.\n\n* **Rule 5:** The sale on **Lamps** must be in an earlier week than the sale on **Headphones**: **L...H**  \n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nSince we have a couple ordering rules, it’s a good idea to note where elements *can’t* go. This can allow you to more quickly deduce in the questions which elements *can* or *must* go into certain spots.\n\n* Since **Lamps** are earlier than **Headphones**, we can deduce that **Lamps** can’t be 7th and **Headphones** can’t be 2nd (the 1st week is reserved for either **T** or **R**, so there’s no way that **Lamps** could be 1st; that means that **Headphones** can’t be 2nd).\n* We can’t do a whole lot with the first couple rules because they’re too open-ended; for example, **PS** *or* **SP** means that we can’t really determine anywhere that **P** or **S** *can’t* go.\n* It’s worth nothing that if **Refrigerators** are on sale in the 1st week, then **Televisions** would get bumped to the 7th week automatically. Look for this to potentially happen in the questions.\n* Also keep in mind that **Headphones** and **Speakers** *must* be separated by at least two other products, so their real estate options are pretty limited. So, if **Refrigerators** were 1st and we were to learn which product is 6th (for example), we would be able to deduce that the 2nd and 5th spots would have to be **H** and **S** in some order. \n\nThere isn’t much more we can deduce, so we might anticipate some “new-if” questions to give us more to work with. Let’s use this **main diagram** to help us solve questions as efficiently as possible.\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n", "images": {"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2e8562039c2c44e7228c28586d3aa7f40469acd6.png": {"height": 414, "width": 800}}, "replace": false, "widgets": {"image 1": {"alignment": "block", "graded": true, "options": {"alt": "A list of elements runs vertically on the left side, H L M P R S T.

We’re told that each booth *must* have at least one employee, but we’re not given further information about how the numbers break down. There isn’t an ordering component to consider, so this is a **grouping setup**. Your initial diagram might look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nNote that at least at the moment, any one of the three booths could have *more* than one employee assigned to it. But, because we can only be certain that *one* employee is there, we only designate one spot in each booth until we gain further information. As we work through the setup and questions, it’ll be worthwhile to pay attention to the **numbers** and how they work out. \n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** The ***retailers*** booth must have more employees than the ***visitors*** booth. We can note this with an “R > V” or whatever notation works well for you. We can also add a spot to the ***retailers*** booth, recognizing that there could still be more employees in either the ***retailers*** or ***visitors*** booth, but there *must* be a minimum of two employees at the ***retailers*** booth now.\n\n* **Rule 2:** Neither **Frank** nor **Keisha** can be assigned to the ***visitors*** booth. We can mark this directly into the diagram next to the ***visitors*** row.\n\n* **Rule 3:** Neither **Gladys** nor **Hal** can be assigned to the ***organizers*** booth. As we did with Rule 2, we can mark this directly into the diagram next to the ***organizers*** row.\n\n* **Rule 4:** **Gladys** and **Mike** must work at the same booth as each other. In other words, **Gladys** and **Mike** are a pair, and we can show this by putting their initials together in a rectangle. \n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* Rule 4 tells us that **GM** is a pair, so since we know that **Gladys** can’t be assigned to the ***organizers*** booth, that means that **Mike** also *can’t* be assigned to the ***organizers*** booth. We can mark that directly into our diagram.\n* Since we’ve now eliminated three possibilities from the ***organizers*** booth, we could mark the remaining employees in the ***organizers*** blank to remind us of who’s left—**Frank**, **Keisha**, and **Laura**.\n* Note that more than one of those three employees could work in the ***organizers*** booth as of now, but it can be helpful to show that one of those three *must* work the ***organizers*** booth.\n* We mentioned in the introduction that it can be helpful to pay attention to the numbers in many Analytical Reasoning tasks.\n* Right now, we’ve placed four of the six total spots, even if we don’t know who goes in each spot.\n* That means that two spots remain to be placed.\n* Given Rule 1, we can deduce that if one of those two spots goes to the ***visitors*** booth, then the other of the two spots would *have* to go to the ***retailers*** booth, and the employee numbers would be 1:3:2, from top to bottom.\n* If the ***visitors*** booth only has one employee, then either the ***organizers*** booth gets 2 and ***retailers*** gets 3, or vice versa. \n* You could build Multiple Scenarios around these numbers possibilities if you like, but it may be enough to just note that the numbers are restricted to only three possibilities.\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n", "images": {}, "replace": false, "widgets": {"group 1": {"options": {"content": "", "images": {}, "widgets": {}}, "type": "group", "version": {"major": 0, "minor": 0}}, "image 1": {"alignment": "block", "graded": true, "options": {"alt": "A list of elements, F G H K L M.\n\nA grouping diagram contains three rows.

There are six total textbooks. The instructions specify that each editor edits at least one textbook (though we can deduce that at least one of the editors will have to edit multiple textbooks, so that all six textbooks are edited). We’re also told that no textbooks are worked on by more than one editor. Since the editors are the subject of each rule, and the number of textbooks that each one edits is variable, it seems reasonable to create a diagram in which the editors are the headers of each row (or column, however you wish to diagram it):\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\n###What the rules tell us\n\n\n* **Rule 1:** ***Ferrer*** must edit either the **linguistics** textbook or the **zoology** textbook, or both. We can note this rule separately from the diagram and also reserve a spot next to ***Ferrer*** for either **linguistics** or **zoology**. Note that ***Ferrer*** could edit *both*, but also might not—that’s why it’s a good idea to note the rule separately, so that we remember that possibility.\n\n* **Rule 2:** If ***Gupta*** edits the **macroeconomics** textbook, he cannot edit any other textbook. This is a conditional logic rule. Let’s note the rule, which is basically that if ***Gupta*** edits **macro**, then ***Gupta*** edits exactly one textbook (**macro**). It’s useful to note the equivalent rule as well: if ***Gupta*** edits *more* than one book, then ***Gupta*** *doesn’t* edit **macroeconomics**.\n\n>It’s important to note that we don’t know what happens if we were to learn that ***Gupta*** edits exactly one book. That book could be **macro**, or it could be something else. If you’re having trouble with this concept, be sure to review the conditional logic articles in your Khan Academy resources!\n\n* **Rule 3:** ***Hendricks*** must edit exactly two textbooks. We can mark this directly in the diagram. There are many ways to show that ***Hendricks*** can’t edit more than two; we chose to “close off” the row with two lines.\n\n* **Rule 4:** ***Hendricks*** cannot edit the **macroeconomics** textbook. Again, we can mark this in the diagram next to the ***Hendricks*** row.\n\n* **Rule 5:** The editor of the **psychology** textbook must also edit the **statistics** textbook. So, **ps** is a pair:\n\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\nAt first glance, solid deductions might appear tough to make. For one thing, there isn’t a lot of overlap among the rules. We see only ***Hendricks*** and **macroeconomics** repeat, so let’s start there:\n\n* ***Hendricks*** can’t edit **macro**, which means that only ***Ferrer*** and ***Gupta*** *can* edit **macro**.\n* That seems like a decent starting point for building **Multiple Scenarios**:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n\n**Scenario 1:** ***Ferrer*** edits **macro**.\n\n* Unfortunately, we can’t determine a whole lot here. \n* We can note that one more spot needs to be placed so that all six textbooks are represented, but that spot could go with either ***Ferrer*** or ***Gupta***. \n* There are too many possibilities for where the **ps** pair can go.\n* We’ll have to hope that we uncover more in the second scenario.\n\n**Scenario 2:** ***Gupta*** edits **macro**.\n\n* Thankfully, we can do more here!\n* We can deduce that ***Gupta*** edits **macro** *only* (Rule 2) and close off the row.\n* Numbers-wise, that means that the remaining two textbooks (whatever they are) need to be edited by ***Ferrer***.\n* The numbers are concretely determined here:\n\n\n\n[[☃ image 4]]\n\n* Note that in Scenario 2, the **ps** pair could fit only with ***Ferrer*** or ***Hendricks***.\n* It seems worth our time to build a third scenario, since that will allow us to determine a *lot* more than if we stopped right here.\n\n**Scenario 2 (revised):** ***Gupta*** edits **macro** and the **ps** pair goes with ***Ferrer***.\n\n* In this case, ***Ferrer*** edits one of **linguistics** and **zoology** and ***Hendricks*** must edit the other.\n* **Russian**, the remaining textbook, must be ***Hendricks’s*** second book (Rule 3).\n* This scenario is almost completely determined!\n\n[[☃ image 5]]\n\n**Scenario 3:** ***Gupta*** edits **macro** and the **ps** pair goes with ***Hendricks***.\n\n* In this case, ***Hendricks*** is now full (Rule 3).\n* That means that ***Ferrer*** must edit **linguistics** *and* **zoology** (Rule 1) as well as the remaining textbook, **Russian**.\n* This situation is completely determined!\n\n[[☃ image 6]]\n\nWe can breathe a sigh of relief, because while that was more work than the typical setup, building the third scenario really allowed us to make some wonderfully concrete deductions. All situations that conform to the setup rules *will* fit into one or more of these Multiple Scenarios. If you’re unsure as to whether this strategy will help on a given setup in which you see the potential for Scenarios, it’s always a good idea to try the setup questions with the Multiple Scenarios *and* without. \n\nLet’s move to the questions with this **main diagram**:\n\n[[☃ image 7]]\n\n\n\n", "images": {}, "replace": false, "widgets": {"image 1": {"alignment": "block", "graded": true, "options": {"alt": "A list of elements l m p r s.\n\nA grouping diagram contains three rows.

For example, the fact that there’s an artist with an “exhibition” and a musician performing during a “reception” isn’t important; it could just as easily be a musician and artist speaking in pairs in each week’s spot. The crux of it is that there are five weeks (there’s our **ordering** component) and an artist/musician pair in each week (there’s our **grouping** component). That means we’re working with a **mixed setup**. Your initial diagram might look like this:\n\n[[☃ image 1]]\n\nWe chose to use lower-case initials for the musicians in order to distinguish artists from musicians. We’ll also write the artists’ names in **bold** and the musicians’ names in ***bold italics*** throughout the setup instructions and question rationales to mimic this distinction. \n\n###What do the rules tell us?\n\n* **Rule 1:** The **Jackson** exhibition is earlier than the **Katz** exhibition, which is earlier than the **Lu** exhibition. This creates a chain of **J...K...L**  \n\n* **Rule 2:** ***Timmons*** performs earlier than ***Vega***, who performs earlier than ***Wilson***. This creates a chain of ***t...v...w***  \n\n* **Rule 3:** ***Wilson*** does not perform in the fourth week. We can mark this directly in the diagram.\n\n* **Rule 4:** ***Yoder*** does not perform at the **Norales** exhibition. So, ***Yoder*** and **Norales** are *not* a pair. We can show this with a crossed-out vertical rectangle, making sure to keep the artist on top and the musician below in order to match the diagram.\n\n* ***Zheng*** performs at the **Odede** exhibition. So, these two *are* a pair, and we can again show this relationship inside a rectangle:\n\n[[☃ image 2]]\n\n###What can we deduce?\n\n* With two ordering chains to work with, we can start by determining where the chains’ elements *can’t* go. This will generally be true any time you’re given a chain of relationships to work with.\n* From Rule 1 we can determine that **Jackson** *can’t* be 4th or 5th, since **Jackson** is followed by at least two other artists.\n* Likewise, we can deduce that **Katz** can’t be 1st or 5th.\n* And, **Lu** can’t be 1st or 2nd.\n* Let’s do the same thing with Rule 2.\n* ***Timmons*** can’t be 4th or 5th,\n* ***Vega*** can’t be 1st or 5th, and\n* ***Wilson*** can’t be 1st or 2nd. \n* We might notice that ***Wilson*** is now the most restricted element, and can only be 3rd or 5th. It’s probably not enough to build Multiple Scenarios around, since one of the Scenarios would be completely empty except for ***Wilson***.\n* There aren’t enough Repeated Elements in the rules to determine much more than this, so let’s move to the questions with this **main diagram**:\n\n[[☃ image 3]]\n\n", "images": {}, "replace": false, "widgets": {"image 1": {"alignment": "block", "graded": true, "options": {"alt": "A mixed diagram consists of two rows of five horizontal bars each to represent a spot, numbered 1 through 5.
