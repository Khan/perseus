## Now we start the actual workflow of the script
##
## A similar set of steps to the 'publish:ci' package.json script
##

verify_env
check_for_changes
pre_publish_check
create_npmrc

yarn build
yarn build:types
yarn extract-strings

# Now version the packages and publish a snapshot
# By using the `--snapshot` option we are asking Changeset to version the
# packages using a snapshot release. We add the formatted PR number as a prefix
# (that's what the option to `--snapshot` signifies. This results in a version
# number that looks like this: "0.0.0-PR423-20230314222716"
# The trailing numbers are a timestamp of when the version was made.
yarn changeset version --snapshot "$PR_NUMBER"

# Now we publish this snapshot version to npm. We use `--tag` to tag this
# version in npm. npm supports any number of tags; in fact, when you `yarn add
# xyz` you are really saying `yarn add xyz@latest` (where latest is a special
# tag that always exists).
# You can see this for yourself by running:
# `yarn info react --json | jq '.data["dist-tags"]'
yarn changeset publish --no-git-tag --tag "${PR_NUMBER}"

# Now we export the npm tag name so that later Github Action steps have access
# to this value in the form of:
# `steps.<name-of-step-that-calls-this-script>.outputs.npm_snapshot_tag`
echo "npm_snapshot_tag=$PR_NUMBER" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

# Now throw away all local changes (we've published a snapshot and that's all
# we needed).
git reset --hard
