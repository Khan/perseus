The Perseus project encompasses several npm libraries written in TypeScript. At its core, Perseus renders Markup to React/HTML and extends Markdown with two special extensions: 1) widgets (custom, React-based UI) and 2) Math (rich math rendering of TeX via MathJax). 

A Perseus item can contain marked-up text (Markdown), images, math (TeX), and widgets. Within a PerseusItem rendered by the ServerItemRenderer it is possible to score the item. Each widget rendered in the item has the ability to provide a question and to score the learner's input. 

Further details about the Pereus architecture are found in the [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md) document.
